To improve the system prompt, we need to provide clearer guidelines on what constitutes a \"question\".

Be concise and respond with only the classification label.\"\n\nBy explicitly defining what each category represents, especially clarifying that an issue asking for potential or clarification about a feature should be classified as a \"question\", the model should have a better chance of correctly identifying the right category. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>In order to improve the system prompt to enhance classification accuracy, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Explicit Definitions**: The original variable does not define the categories 'bug', 'feature', or 'question'. This lack of clarity can lead to misclassification. Including explicit definitions for each category would help the language model distinguish between them effectively.\n\n2. **Example-Driven Approach**: Providing examples of typical titles or descriptions for each category could aid in improving classification accuracy. For instance, a sample of what a 'question' might look like or entail would help the language model make more informed decisions.\n\n3. **Contextual Clarity**: The prompt should emphasize, perhaps more strongly, the context in which the model should consider the provided information. Adding a statement on considering the tone or linguistic cues that typically differentiate questions from feature requests or bug reports might be beneficial.\n\n4. **Focus on Ambiguity**: Acknowledge and address potential sources of ambiguity that come with distinguishing between 'feature' and 'question', as in the example. Emphasizing the intent behind the language - whether it seeks information or confirmation versus suggesting a new feature - could guide better classification.\n\n5. **Reinforcement of 'Question' Category**: Pay special attention to reinforcing what constitutes a 'question' by describing its contextual markers, such as interrogative sentences, requests for information, and clarifications about existing features or future possibilities.\n\n6. **Subtle Prompt Adjustments**: The phrase \"Be concise and respond with only the classification label\" remains helpful for output formatting, but it might be more effective if coupled with specific language about ensuring accuracy over brevity when in doubt.\n\nBy integrating these changes, the system prompt will be better aligned with the objective of precise and accurate classification of GitHub issues into the predefined categories.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (system prompt for classification) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}
