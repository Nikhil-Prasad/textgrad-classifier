Consider including synonyms or related phrases like \"malfunction,\" \"buggy,\" \"anomaly,\" and \"defect.\"\n\n2. **Define 'non_bug' More Explicitly:** Incorporate examples or descriptors that distinctly classify what constitutes a 'non_bug' issue.

Adding more detail on what constitutes ambiguity and why it usually leads to a 'non_bug' classification could refine decision-making. For instance, specifying scenarios where requests are marked as non-bugs despite using some 'bug' terms might help.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**: It may improve the prompt by urging the system to evaluate the context more holistically, perhaps taking into account the section of the description the terms appear in, or whether the issue is syntactically seeking a resolution suggestive of a bug fix or an enhancement request.\n\n5. **Example Scenarios**: The system could benefit from having explicitly defined example scenarios, both textual and abstract, that differentiate between 'bug' and 'non_bug' issues. Scenarios should include varied linguistic styles found in real issue reports, highlighting how non-bug issues are typically worded, no matter how subtle.\n\n6. **Focus on Intent Signals**: Adding a focus on the intention behind reported issues\u2014whether resolving a symptom of malfunction or suggesting an improvement\u2014can provide another layer for determining the classification as 'non_bug'.\n\n7. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**: The prompt could be improved by incorporating a feedback loop that allows the system to learn from classification mistakes, especially those that have occurred due to subtle misunderstanding of language cues.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, the prompt may more effectively classify issues as 'non_bug', aligning more closely with the intended objective.", "message": "_backward_through_llm gradient"}

Including definitions can prevent misclassifications and guide the model even if there are ambiguous cases.\n\n3. **Incorporate Domain-specific Terms**: The prompt could benefit from stating specific language used in bug reporting, such as \"Does the issue include words indicating a malfunction, like 'error', 'crash', or 'fail'?\"\n\n4. **Reinforce Contextual Analysis**: While the prompt currently instructs the model to use the title and description, explicitly reinforcing the importance of understanding the issue context could enhance model insights. For example, \"Consider both the title and description context to determine the bug classification.\" \n\n5. **Guided Examples and Expectations**: To further enhance the prompt\u2019s effectiveness, consider adding information on providing examples or expecting common patterns within issues, such as \"Look for patterns indicating a malfunction.\"\n\n6. **Specificity in Labeling**: While the model is asked to be concise already, emphasizing that the classification should only consider direct evidence of a bug may prevent overgeneralization: \"Label only when clear evidence of malfunction is stated.\"\n\nImplementing these elements has the potential to refine the classification system\u2019s prompt by providing more structured, clear, and domain-focused instructions, thus aiming to boost further improvements in the classification accuracy aligned with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the classification system's prompt and consequently enhance its performance, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Expand Keyword Recognition for 'bug':** While the prompt already includes some terms that indicate a bug, expanding this list can reduce ambiguity. Consider including synonyms or related phrases like \"malfunction,\" \"buggy,\" \"anomaly,\" and \"defect.\"\n\n2. **Define 'non_bug' More Explicitly:** Incorporate examples or descriptors that distinctly classify what constitutes a 'non_bug' issue. As suggested, terms like \"feature request,\" \"improvement,\" \"update without issues,\" or \"discussion proposal\" can provide clarity.\n\n3. **Example-Based Learning:** Integrate short, illustrative examples within the prompt that depict common scenarios of both 'bug' and 'non_bug' classifications. This could serve as a more tangible guide for classification.\n\n4. **Encourage Multi-Factor Evaluation:** Encourage the system to consider the overall sentiment and language nuances within the title and description rather than relying solely on explicit keywords. This can improve classification in cases where users express malfunctions indirectly.\n\n5. **Emphasize Contextual Understanding:** Stress the importance of contextual comprehension. Suggest the system evaluate how terms are used in context\u2014for instance, whether \"error\" appears in the context of a question (which could be 'non_bug') versus as evidence of malfunction.\n\n6. **State Ambiguity Handling:** Guide the system on how to handle ambiguous cases where evidence of a bug isn\u2019t clear-cut, perhaps defaulting to 'non_bug' unless the presence of a bug is strongly indicated.\n\nIncorporating these feedback points could bolster the system's ability to accurately classify issues more consistently, thereby aligning better with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

A 'bug' is typically indicated by terms such as \"error\", \"crash\", \"unexpected behavior\", \"fails\", \"malfunction\", \"buggy\", \"anomaly\", or \"defect\". Conversely, 'non_bug' issues might involve feature requests, enhancements, questions, suggestions, improvements, updates without issues, or discussion proposals. Evaluate both the title and description context to determine the classification, considering overall sentiment and language nuances. Label 'bug' only when clear and direct evidence of malfunction is present; default to 'non_bug' if evidence is ambiguous.

However, to further strengthen its ability to identify 'non_bug' issues, consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Include Examples**: Provide a few examples of typical 'non_bug' indicators, such as phrases or terms commonly found in feature requests or discussions.\n\n2. **Clarify Ambiguity Handling**: Emphasize that when language is vague or when it includes terms but lacks details about malfunctions, it's safer to choose 'non_bug'.\n\n3. **Encourage Attention to Details**: Reinforce that hints of a malfunction must be explicit and direct to classify something as a 'bug'. Encourage careful attention to the full context to avoid misclassification.\n\nBy incorporating these enhancements, the prompt may help reduce instances where issues might be unclear but are more consistent with 'non_bug' classifications. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification and better achieve the objective of correctly classifying issues as 'non_bug,' here are some feedback suggestions:\n\n1. **Expand Descriptive Language**: While the prompt mentions several terms that indicate a 'bug,' it could benefit from a broader exploration of language nuances. Consider incorporating examples of language that might disguise itself as a bug, such as ambiguous wording, to better train the system to recognize when something is genuinely not a 'bug'.\n\n2. **Positive vs. Negative Tone**: Currently, the prompt emphasizes language that points toward a malfunction. It may be beneficial to train the system to recognize positive language or constructive feedback typically associated with 'non_bug' reports, such as \"add\", \"enhance\", \"develop\", or \"consider\".\n\n3. **Refine Ambiguity Handling**: The prompt instructs to default to 'non_bug' when evidence is ambiguous, which can be too simplistic. Adding more detail on what constitutes ambiguity and why it usually leads to a 'non_bug' classification could refine decision-making. For instance, specifying scenarios where requests are marked as non-bugs despite using some 'bug' terms might help.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**: It may improve the prompt by urging the system to evaluate the context more holistically, perhaps taking into account the section of the description the terms appear in, or whether the issue is syntactically seeking a resolution suggestive of a bug fix or an enhancement request.\n\n5. **Example Scenarios**: The system could benefit from having explicitly defined example scenarios, both textual and abstract, that differentiate between 'bug' and 'non_bug' issues. Scenarios should include varied linguistic styles found in real issue reports, highlighting how non-bug issues are typically worded, no matter how subtle.\n\n6. **Focus on Intent Signals**: Adding a focus on the intention behind reported issues\u2014whether resolving a symptom of malfunction or suggesting an improvement\u2014can provide another layer for determining the classification as 'non_bug'.\n\n7. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**: The prompt could be improved by incorporating a feedback loop that allows the system to learn from classification mistakes, especially those that have occurred due to subtle misunderstanding of language cues.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, the prompt may more effectively classify issues as 'non_bug', aligning more closely with the intended objective.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (system prompt for classification) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

Highlight that understanding the user's intent is key to making an accurate classification.\n\n2. **Refine Ambiguity Guidance**: Encourage the system to err on the side of 'non_bug' when the evidence is not explicitly linked to a malfunction. Emphasize analyzing ambiguous cases carefully to determine if the issue might be more suggestive of an improvement or discussion rather than a bug.\n\n3. **Highlight Positive Language and Intent**: Reinforce the identification of language focused on improvements, feature requests, and enhancements as indicators of 'non_bug'. Encourage the recognition of language aiming to enhance or add new functionality rather than correcting a failure.\n\n4. **Past Misunderstandings**: Include a suggestion to review specific examples of past classifications, focusing particularly on those where language cues may have led to incorrect predictions. This could help refine the model's understanding of nuanced cues.\n\n5. **Explicit Examples**: Incorporate additional examples of both 'bug' and 'non_bug' classifications within the prompt to guide the system. Use sample issues that highlight common misunderstanding cues and clarify them.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the system can improve its accuracy in distinguishing bug-related issues from non_bug issues when the evidence isn't explicitly clear-cut. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>1. **Contextual Emphasis**: The prompt already suggests using a holistic contextual analysis, but it could benefit from clearer articulation on how to balance the title and description. Consider advising the system to weigh the severity of terms related to malfunction against suggestive terms for improvements, guiding it towards a more integrative approach in understanding user intent.\n\n2. **Explicit Language Patterns**: The current list of bug-related and non_bug indicators is useful. However, expanding it with additional synonyms or related terms that frequently appear in real-world reports could improve accuracy. Encourage the system to use ontologies or thesauri to identify synonyms of key terms and double-check contextual alignment.\n\n3. **Ambiguity Decision Path**: While the guidance to classify ambiguous evidence as 'non_bug' is included, the framework for determining ambiguity could be refined with more concrete guidelines or questions. For instance, suggesting a decision flow-chart or set questions like \"Is the malfunction explicitly stated or inferred?\" could help the system in its decision-making when faced with ambiguity.\n\n4. **Review Process**: Add instructions for the system to periodically self-check previous similar classifications, particularly where the decision was borderline. Incorporating a feedback loop or learning mechanism within the prompt could help mitigate misunderstandings and improve learning.\n\n5. **Misleading Cues**: It may help to expand on how positive language or terms associated with enhancements can be misleading when present in a bug report. Providing brief examples or anecdotes within the prompt for cases where positive language masked the discussion of a malfunction might sharpen the model's ability to distinguish between subtly misleading cues.\n\n6. **Use of Examples**: Including concrete, concise examples within the prompt itself can serve as guidelines, illustrating successful and erroneous classifications. This can especially aid in showing patterns of misinterpretation, reinforcing correct labels with tangible instances.\n\nBy refining these elements, the system prompt could be better equipped to accurately classify issues and reduce the chance of ambiguous cases being incorrectly labeled.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

This can help in distinguishing between feature requests, questions, and bug reports.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition**: Encourage the identification of patterns or keywords that are commonly associated with bugs, like \"crash\", \"unexpected\", \"fails\", etc.\n\n4. **Contextual Understanding**: Suggest understanding the problem's context, like whether it's related to functionality, performance, or usability, which can further aid classification.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the system's accuracy in identifying bug reports can be improved further, even if it already performed correctly in this instance. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>1. **Simplification and Clarification**: Although the system prompt is performing accurately in this instance, further simplification and clarification could enhance its robustness. For example, emphasizing a more straightforward structure by stating, \"Identify if the issue is a bug or not, based on the title and description\u2014use only 'bug' or 'non_bug'.\"\n\n2. **Explicit Definitions**: Adding a brief definition or criteria for what classifies an issue as a 'bug' versus a 'non_bug' could provide clearer guidance. Including definitions can prevent misclassifications and guide the model even if there are ambiguous cases.\n\n3. **Incorporate Domain-specific Terms**: The prompt could benefit from stating specific language used in bug reporting, such as \"Does the issue include words indicating a malfunction, like 'error', 'crash', or 'fail'?\"\n\n4. **Reinforce Contextual Analysis**: While the prompt currently instructs the model to use the title and description, explicitly reinforcing the importance of understanding the issue context could enhance model insights. For example, \"Consider both the title and description context to determine the bug classification.\" \n\n5. **Guided Examples and Expectations**: To further enhance the prompt\u2019s effectiveness, consider adding information on providing examples or expecting common patterns within issues, such as \"Look for patterns indicating a malfunction.\"\n\n6. **Specificity in Labeling**: While the model is asked to be concise already, emphasizing that the classification should only consider direct evidence of a bug may prevent overgeneralization: \"Label only when clear evidence of malfunction is stated.\"\n\nImplementing these elements has the potential to refine the classification system\u2019s prompt by providing more structured, clear, and domain-focused instructions, thus aiming to boost further improvements in the classification accuracy aligned with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

Consider including synonyms or related phrases like \"malfunction,\" \"buggy,\" \"anomaly,\" and \"defect.\"\n\n2. **Define 'non_bug' More Explicitly:** Incorporate examples or descriptors that distinctly classify what constitutes a 'non_bug' issue. As suggested, terms like \"feature request,\" \"improvement,\" \"update without issues,\" or \"discussion proposal\" can provide clarity.\n\n3. **Example-Based Learning:** Integrate short, illustrative examples within the prompt that depict common scenarios of both 'bug' and 'non_bug' classifications. This could serve as a more tangible guide for classification.\n\n4. **Encourage Multi-Factor Evaluation:** Encourage the system to consider the overall sentiment and language nuances within the title and description rather than relying solely on explicit keywords. This can improve classification in cases where users express malfunctions indirectly.\n\n5. **Emphasize Contextual Understanding:** Stress the importance of contextual comprehension. Suggest the system evaluate how terms are used in context\u2014for instance, whether \"error\" appears in the context of a question (which could be 'non_bug') versus as evidence of malfunction.\n\n6. **State Ambiguity Handling:** Guide the system on how to handle ambiguous cases where evidence of a bug isn\u2019t clear-cut, perhaps defaulting to 'non_bug' unless the presence of a bug is strongly indicated.\n\nIncorporating these feedback points could bolster the system's ability to accurately classify issues more consistently, thereby aligning better with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

Encourage careful attention to the full context to avoid misclassification.\n\nBy incorporating these enhancements, the prompt may help reduce instances where issues might be unclear but are more consistent with 'non_bug' classifications. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification and better achieve the objective of correctly classifying issues as 'non_bug,' here are some feedback suggestions:\n\n1. **Expand Descriptive Language**: While the prompt mentions several terms that indicate a 'bug,' it could benefit from a broader exploration of language nuances. Consider incorporating examples of language that might disguise itself as a bug, such as ambiguous wording, to better train the system to recognize when something is genuinely not a 'bug'.\n\n2. **Positive vs. Negative Tone**: Currently, the prompt emphasizes language that points toward a malfunction. It may be beneficial to train the system to recognize positive language or constructive feedback typically associated with 'non_bug' reports, such as \"add\", \"enhance\", \"develop\", or \"consider\".\n\n3. **Refine Ambiguity Handling**: The prompt instructs to default to 'non_bug' when evidence is ambiguous, which can be too simplistic. Adding more detail on what constitutes ambiguity and why it usually leads to a 'non_bug' classification could refine decision-making. For instance, specifying scenarios where requests are marked as non-bugs despite using some 'bug' terms might help.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**: It may improve the prompt by urging the system to evaluate the context more holistically, perhaps taking into account the section of the description the terms appear in, or whether the issue is syntactically seeking a resolution suggestive of a bug fix or an enhancement request.\n\n5. **Example Scenarios**: The system could benefit from having explicitly defined example scenarios, both textual and abstract, that differentiate between 'bug' and 'non_bug' issues. Scenarios should include varied linguistic styles found in real issue reports, highlighting how non-bug issues are typically worded, no matter how subtle.\n\n6. **Focus on Intent Signals**: Adding a focus on the intention behind reported issues\u2014whether resolving a symptom of malfunction or suggesting an improvement\u2014can provide another layer for determining the classification as 'non_bug'.\n\n7. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**: The prompt could be improved by incorporating a feedback loop that allows the system to learn from classification mistakes, especially those that have occurred due to subtle misunderstanding of language cues.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, the prompt may more effectively classify issues as 'non_bug', aligning more closely with the intended objective.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (system prompt for classification) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

Highlight that understanding the user's intent is key to making an accurate classification.\n\n2. **Refine Ambiguity Guidance**: Encourage the system to err on the side of 'non_bug' when the evidence is not explicitly linked to a malfunction. Emphasize analyzing ambiguous cases carefully to determine if the issue might be more suggestive of an improvement or discussion rather than a bug.\n\n3. **Highlight Positive Language and Intent**: Reinforce the identification of language focused on improvements, feature requests, and enhancements as indicators of 'non_bug'. Encourage the recognition of language aiming to enhance or add new functionality rather than correcting a failure.\n\n4. **Past Misunderstandings**: Include a suggestion to review specific examples of past classifications, focusing particularly on those where language cues may have led to incorrect predictions. This could help refine the model's understanding of nuanced cues.\n\n5. **Explicit Examples**: Incorporate additional examples of both 'bug' and 'non_bug' classifications within the prompt to guide the system.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>1. **Contextual Emphasis**: The prompt already suggests using a holistic contextual analysis, but it could benefit from clearer articulation on how to balance the title and description. Consider advising the system to weigh the severity of terms related to malfunction against suggestive terms for improvements, guiding it towards a more integrative approach in understanding user intent.\n\n2. **Explicit Language Patterns**: The current list of bug-related and non_bug indicators is useful. However, expanding it with additional synonyms or related terms that frequently appear in real-world reports could improve accuracy. Encourage the system to use ontologies or thesauri to identify synonyms of key terms and double-check contextual alignment.\n\n3. **Ambiguity Decision Path**: While the guidance to classify ambiguous evidence as 'non_bug' is included, the framework for determining ambiguity could be refined with more concrete guidelines or questions. For instance, suggesting a decision flow-chart or set questions like \"Is the malfunction explicitly stated or inferred?\" could help the system in its decision-making when faced with ambiguity.\n\n4. **Review Process**: Add instructions for the system to periodically self-check previous similar classifications, particularly where the decision was borderline. Incorporating a feedback loop or learning mechanism within the prompt could help mitigate misunderstandings and improve learning.\n\n5. **Misleading Cues**: It may help to expand on how positive language or terms associated with enhancements can be misleading when present in a bug report. Providing brief examples or anecdotes within the prompt for cases where positive language masked the discussion of a malfunction might sharpen the model's ability to distinguish between subtly misleading cues.\n\n6. **Use of Examples**: Including concrete, concise examples within the prompt itself can serve as guidelines, illustrating successful and erroneous classifications. This can especially aid in showing patterns of misinterpretation, reinforcing correct labels with tangible instances.\n\nBy refining these elements, the system prompt could be better equipped to accurately classify issues and reduce the chance of ambiguous cases being incorrectly labeled.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

Encourage careful attention to the full context to avoid misclassification.\n\nBy incorporating these enhancements, the prompt may help reduce instances where issues might be unclear but are more consistent with 'non_bug' classifications. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification and better achieve the objective of correctly classifying issues as 'non_bug,' here are some feedback suggestions:\n\n1. **Expand Descriptive Language**: While the prompt mentions several terms that indicate a 'bug,' it could benefit from a broader exploration of language nuances. Consider incorporating examples of language that might disguise itself as a bug, such as ambiguous wording, to better train the system to recognize when something is genuinely not a 'bug'.\n\n2. **Positive vs. Negative Tone**: Currently, the prompt emphasizes language that points toward a malfunction. It may be beneficial to train the system to recognize positive language or constructive feedback typically associated with 'non_bug' reports, such as \"add\", \"enhance\", \"develop\", or \"consider\".\n\n3. **Refine Ambiguity Handling**: The prompt instructs to default to 'non_bug' when evidence is ambiguous, which can be too simplistic. Adding more detail on what constitutes ambiguity and why it usually leads to a 'non_bug' classification could refine decision-making. For instance, specifying scenarios where requests are marked as non-bugs despite using some 'bug' terms might help.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**: It may improve the prompt by urging the system to evaluate the context more holistically, perhaps taking into account the section of the description the terms appear in, or whether the issue is syntactically seeking a resolution suggestive of a bug fix or an enhancement request.\n\n5. **Example Scenarios**: The system could benefit from having explicitly defined example scenarios, both textual and abstract, that differentiate between 'bug' and 'non_bug' issues. Scenarios should include varied linguistic styles found in real issue reports, highlighting how non-bug issues are typically worded, no matter how subtle.\n\n6. **Focus on Intent Signals**: Adding a focus on the intention behind reported issues\u2014whether resolving a symptom of malfunction or suggesting an improvement\u2014can provide another layer for determining the classification as 'non_bug'.\n\n7. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**: The prompt could be improved by incorporating a feedback loop that allows the system to learn from classification mistakes, especially those that have occurred due to subtle misunderstanding of language cues.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, the prompt may more effectively classify issues as 'non_bug', aligning more closely with the intended objective.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For example, \"Consider both the title and description context to determine the bug classification.\" \n\n5. **Guided Examples and Expectations**: To further enhance the prompt\u2019s effectiveness, consider adding information on providing examples or expecting common patterns within issues, such as \"Look for patterns indicating a malfunction.\"\n\n6. **Specificity in Labeling**: While the model is asked to be concise already, emphasizing that the classification should only consider direct evidence of a bug may prevent overgeneralization: \"Label only when clear evidence of malfunction is stated.\"\n\nImplementing these elements has the potential to refine the classification system\u2019s prompt by providing more structured, clear, and domain-focused instructions, thus aiming to boost further improvements in the classification accuracy aligned with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

However, to reinforce the accuracy of such classifications in future cases, the prompt could be enhanced to incorporate clearer definitions or examples of both 'bug' and 'non_bug' scenarios. Here are some suggested changes:\n\n1. **Include Additional Context for 'non_bug':** Add examples or keywords that could indicate a 'non_bug' issue, such as \"feature request\", \"enhancement\", \"question\", or \"suggestion\".\n\n2. **Clarify 'non_bug' Scenarios:** Highlight that issues focusing on improvements, discussions, or clarifications without evidence of malfunction are likely 'non_bug'.\n\nHere\u2019s an improved version of the prompt:\n\n---\n\nIdentify if the issue is a bug or not based on the title and description\u2014use only 'bug' or 'non_bug'. A 'bug' is indicated by explicit terms like \"error\", \"crash\", \"unexpected behavior\", or \"fails\". Consider both the title and description context to arrive at your classification.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the classification system's prompt and consequently enhance its performance, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Expand Keyword Recognition for 'bug':** While the prompt already includes some terms that indicate a bug, expanding this list can reduce ambiguity. Consider including synonyms or related phrases like \"malfunction,\" \"buggy,\" \"anomaly,\" and \"defect.\"\n\n2. **Define 'non_bug' More Explicitly:** Incorporate examples or descriptors that distinctly classify what constitutes a 'non_bug' issue. As suggested, terms like \"feature request,\" \"improvement,\" \"update without issues,\" or \"discussion proposal\" can provide clarity.\n\n3. **Example-Based Learning:** Integrate short, illustrative examples within the prompt that depict common scenarios of both 'bug' and 'non_bug' classifications. This could serve as a more tangible guide for classification.\n\n4. **Encourage Multi-Factor Evaluation:** Encourage the system to consider the overall sentiment and language nuances within the title and description rather than relying solely on explicit keywords. This can improve classification in cases where users express malfunctions indirectly.\n\n5. **Emphasize Contextual Understanding:** Stress the importance of contextual comprehension. Suggest the system evaluate how terms are used in context\u2014for instance, whether \"error\" appears in the context of a question (which could be 'non_bug') versus as evidence of malfunction.\n\n6. **State Ambiguity Handling:** Guide the system on how to handle ambiguous cases where evidence of a bug isn\u2019t clear-cut, perhaps defaulting to 'non_bug' unless the presence of a bug is strongly indicated.\n\nIncorporating these feedback points could bolster the system's ability to accurately classify issues more consistently, thereby aligning better with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (system prompt for classification) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

The prompt currently instructs to consider context, but elaborating on how evaluators might assess contextual relevance could be useful. You could, for example, provide guidance on recognizing the tone and intent beyond just specific words, such as distinguishing between exploratory language and direct problem statements.\n\n2. **Incorporate More Distinguishing Features**: Expand on the lexical and contextual signals that distinguish 'bug' from 'non_bug'. Currently, specific keywords and phrases are noted, but further categorization of phrases that often lead to misclassification could refine accuracy. For instance, phrases indicating uncertainty or potential for improvement like \"could be improved\" or \"does not currently\" often relate to 'non_bug'.\n\n3. **Directive on Handling Mixed Signals**: Present strategies for dealing with titles or descriptions that include mixed language (bug-related terms alongside non-bug phrasing). Clearly articulate how to prioritize evidence, and provide concrete steps for unpacking issues when conflicting signals are present.\n\n4. **Guidance on Past Classifications as Reference**: Although the prompt mentions learning from past classifications, specifying how to utilize historical data effectively would be beneficial. Outline how patterns can be recognized, with examples of past misclassifications and what led to their correction.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Classification Decision Tree**: Consider a simple decision tree or flowchart within the text or as an accompanying reference to assist in the thought process for classification. A decision tree would help systematically address ambiguities and guide the evaluator through logical decision-making pathways.\n\n6. **Clarity and Conciseness**: While advising evaluators to be concise, ensure the prompt remains direct and clear without overloading them with too much detail. Conciseness is crucial, but not at the cost of missing vital decision-making criteria.\n\nOverall, the combination of examples, clearer guidelines on interpreting mixed signals, and using a structured approach can facilitate improved classification accuracy for issues reported as 'non_bug'.", "message": "_backward_through_llm gradient"}

However, expanding it with additional synonyms or related terms that frequently appear in real-world reports could improve accuracy. Encourage the system to use ontologies or thesauri to identify synonyms of key terms and double-check contextual alignment.\n\n3. **Ambiguity Decision Path**: While the guidance to classify ambiguous evidence as 'non_bug' is included, the framework for determining ambiguity could be refined with more concrete guidelines or questions. For instance, suggesting a decision flow-chart or set questions like \"Is the malfunction explicitly stated or inferred?\" could help the system in its decision-making when faced with ambiguity.\n\n4. **Review Process**: Add instructions for the system to periodically self-check previous similar classifications, particularly where the decision was borderline. Incorporating a feedback loop or learning mechanism within the prompt could help mitigate misunderstandings and improve learning.\n\n5. **Misleading Cues**: It may help to expand on how positive language or terms associated with enhancements can be misleading when present in a bug report. Providing brief examples or anecdotes within the prompt for cases where positive language masked the discussion of a malfunction might sharpen the model's ability to distinguish between subtly misleading cues.\n\n6. **Use of Examples**: Including concrete, concise examples within the prompt itself can serve as guidelines, illustrating successful and erroneous classifications. This can especially aid in showing patterns of misinterpretation, reinforcing correct labels with tangible instances.\n\nBy refining these elements, the system prompt could be better equipped to accurately classify issues and reduce the chance of ambiguous cases being incorrectly labeled.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

However, you can incorporate additional clarifications and examples to further reduce ambiguities. Here is a suggested improvement to the prompt:\n\n1. **Explicit Examples**: Include specific examples of 'non_bug' issues to enhance recognition, such as \"Feature requests typically include phrases like 'add', 'implement', 'support', or 'consider enhancing'.\"\n\n2. **Contextual Cues**: Encourage the evaluator to take note of context cues more precisely. For example, \"If the title or description mentions error-related words but is paired with language suggesting a request or idea, consider the overall intent before deciding.\"\n\n3. **Highlight Ambiguities**: Clarify what constitutes ambiguity by stating, \"If the issue includes error-related terms but overall expresses ideas for potential improvements without clear examples of a problem, lean towards 'non_bug'.\"\n\n4. **Common False Indicators**: Offer insights into commonly misinterpreted phrases. For example, \"Phrases like 'explore options' or 'interested in feedback' often point towards 'non_bug' classifications, despite technical terminology.\"\n\nRevised Prompt:\n\"Identify if the issue is a bug or not, based on the title and description\u2014use only 'bug' or 'non_bug'.

'Non_bug' issues are often feature requests, enhancements, questions, suggestions, improvements, updates without issues, or discussion proposals. Feature requests commonly use terms like 'add', 'implement', 'support', or 'consider enhancing'. Always consider both title and description together to determine classification, and analyze sentiment, language nuances, and intent signals. If error-related terms are included with language like 'explore options' or 'interested in feedback', the issue might be 'non_bug'. Only label 'bug' when clear, direct evidence of malfunction is present; otherwise, use 'non_bug'.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the classification system prompt and thereby enhance the system's ability to accurately categorize GitHub issues, the following suggestions can be made:\n\n1. **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: Encourage a more nuanced analysis of context and language in the issue description. The prompt currently instructs to consider context, but elaborating on how evaluators might assess contextual relevance could be useful. You could, for example, provide guidance on recognizing the tone and intent beyond just specific words, such as distinguishing between exploratory language and direct problem statements.\n\n2. **Incorporate More Distinguishing Features**: Expand on the lexical and contextual signals that distinguish 'bug' from 'non_bug'. Currently, specific keywords and phrases are noted, but further categorization of phrases that often lead to misclassification could refine accuracy. For instance, phrases indicating uncertainty or potential for improvement like \"could be improved\" or \"does not currently\" often relate to 'non_bug'.\n\n3. **Directive on Handling Mixed Signals**: Present strategies for dealing with titles or descriptions that include mixed language (bug-related terms alongside non-bug phrasing). Clearly articulate how to prioritize evidence, and provide concrete steps for unpacking issues when conflicting signals are present.\n\n4. **Guidance on Past Classifications as Reference**: Although the prompt mentions learning from past classifications, specifying how to utilize historical data effectively would be beneficial. Outline how patterns can be recognized, with examples of past misclassifications and what led to their correction.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Classification Decision Tree**: Consider a simple decision tree or flowchart within the text or as an accompanying reference to assist in the thought process for classification. A decision tree would help systematically address ambiguities and guide the evaluator through logical decision-making pathways.\n\n6. **Clarity and Conciseness**: While advising evaluators to be concise, ensure the prompt remains direct and clear without overloading them with too much detail. Conciseness is crucial, but not at the cost of missing vital decision-making criteria.\n\nOverall, the combination of examples, clearer guidelines on interpreting mixed signals, and using a structured approach can facilitate improved classification accuracy for issues reported as 'non_bug'.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

However, to further strengthen its ability to identify 'non_bug' issues, consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Include Examples**: Provide a few examples of typical 'non_bug' indicators, such as phrases or terms commonly found in feature requests or discussions.\n\n2. **Clarify Ambiguity Handling**: Emphasize that when language is vague or when it includes terms but lacks details about malfunctions, it's safer to choose 'non_bug'.\n\n3. **Encourage Attention to Details**: Reinforce that hints of a malfunction must be explicit and direct to classify something as a 'bug'. Encourage careful attention to the full context to avoid misclassification.\n\nBy incorporating these enhancements, the prompt may help reduce instances where issues might be unclear but are more consistent with 'non_bug' classifications. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification and better achieve the objective of correctly classifying issues as 'non_bug,' here are some feedback suggestions:\n\n1. **Expand Descriptive Language**: While the prompt mentions several terms that indicate a 'bug,' it could benefit from a broader exploration of language nuances. Consider incorporating examples of language that might disguise itself as a bug, such as ambiguous wording, to better train the system to recognize when something is genuinely not a 'bug'.\n\n2. **Positive vs. Negative Tone**: Currently, the prompt emphasizes language that points toward a malfunction. It may be beneficial to train the system to recognize positive language or constructive feedback typically associated with 'non_bug' reports, such as \"add\", \"enhance\", \"develop\", or \"consider\".\n\n3. **Refine Ambiguity Handling**: The prompt instructs to default to 'non_bug' when evidence is ambiguous, which can be too simplistic. Adding more detail on what constitutes ambiguity and why it usually leads to a 'non_bug' classification could refine decision-making. For instance, specifying scenarios where requests are marked as non-bugs despite using some 'bug' terms might help.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**: It may improve the prompt by urging the system to evaluate the context more holistically, perhaps taking into account the section of the description the terms appear in, or whether the issue is syntactically seeking a resolution suggestive of a bug fix or an enhancement request.\n\n5. **Example Scenarios**: The system could benefit from having explicitly defined example scenarios, both textual and abstract, that differentiate between 'bug' and 'non_bug' issues. Scenarios should include varied linguistic styles found in real issue reports, highlighting how non-bug issues are typically worded, no matter how subtle.\n\n6. **Focus on Intent Signals**: Adding a focus on the intention behind reported issues\u2014whether resolving a symptom of malfunction or suggesting an improvement\u2014can provide another layer for determining the classification as 'non_bug'.\n\n7. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**: The prompt could be improved by incorporating a feedback loop that allows the system to learn from classification mistakes, especially those that have occurred due to subtle misunderstanding of language cues.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, the prompt may more effectively classify issues as 'non_bug', aligning more closely with the intended objective.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

However, we can provide feedback to refine and optimize the prompt further for such cases:\n\n1. **Emphasize Context Evaluation**: Encourage the system to deeply evaluate whether the context implies suggestions, feature requests, or general improvements rather than potential malfunctions.\n\n2. **Clarify Ambiguity Handling**: The prompt already advises defaulting to 'non_bug' in ambiguous cases, but adding further clarification could help. For example:\n   - \"In cases where the distinction is subtle and specific terms indicating a bug are absent, prioritize 'non_bug'.\"\n\n3. **Inclusion of Additional Non-Bug Indicators**: Expand the list of 'non_bug' indicators to include more keywords and phrases that suggest improvements or discussions, such as \"would be nice\", \"consider adding\", or \"question about\".\n\n4. **Examples of Non-Bug**: Include brief examples of words or phrases that typically align with non-bug issues to help better discern such instances.\n\nRevised prompt suggestion:\n\"Identify if the issue is a bug or not based on the title and description\u2014use only 'bug' or 'non_bug'.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>1. **Focus on Contextual Understanding**: Encourage the system to use more contextual understanding of the description and title rather than just keyword matching. For example, train the model to recognize patterns of language that typically surround non-bug discussions, even if they don't contain the specific keywords listed.\n\n2. **Explicit Instruction for Learning**: The prompt could more explicitly instruct the system to learn from past classifications, encouraging it to adapt over time by keeping track of patterns that led to correct and incorrect classifications.\n\n3. **Linguistic Nuances**: Expand the emphasis on linguistic nuances. For instance, the system may look for more nuanced expressions that suggest a non-bug nature, such as conditional expressions (\"if only this could\") or speculative language (\"it might be more effective\").\n\n4. **Enhanced Clarity on Ambiguity**: The handling of ambiguity appears important but could be enhanced by stressing how to discern subtle indications of requests rather than errors. This might involve an indication of weighing non-bug indicators more heavily in the absence of direct bug evidence.\n\n5. **Real World Example Inclusion**: Include examples of actual past classifications where ambiguous issues have correctly been labeled as 'non_bug'. Use these examples as anchor points for what the model should identify. This practical application would help in developing a more robust understanding.\n\n6. **Hierarchical Assessment Approach**: Advise the system to take a hierarchy-based approach where it first checks for explicit bug indicators, then looks at non-bug indicators, and finally reviews for potential ambiguities. This layered approach can help in both speed and accuracy.\n\n7. **Sentiment Analysis Component**: Suggest incorporating sentiment analysis to differentiate between user frustration (which might correlate with bugs) and neutral or positive sentiments (suggesting feature enhancements or non-bug discussions).\n\n8. **Phrase Pattern Recognition**: Suggesting the use of regular expressions or pattern recognition for typical non-bug phrases could enhance prompt efficiency. This could include checking for sentence structures common in suggestions or questions reflective of non-bugs.\n\nBy integrating these methodologies, the system prompt can improve its classification performance, reducing misclassifications and enhancing its learning capabilities over time.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For example, emphasizing a more straightforward structure by stating, \"Identify if the issue is a bug or not, based on the title and description\u2014use only 'bug' or 'non_bug'.\"\n\n2. **Explicit Definitions**: Adding a brief definition or criteria for what classifies an issue as a 'bug' versus a 'non_bug' could provide clearer guidance. Including definitions can prevent misclassifications and guide the model even if there are ambiguous cases.\n\n3. **Incorporate Domain-specific Terms**: The prompt could benefit from stating specific language used in bug reporting, such as \"Does the issue include words indicating a malfunction, like 'error', 'crash', or 'fail'?\"\n\n4. **Reinforce Contextual Analysis**: While the prompt currently instructs the model to use the title and description, explicitly reinforcing the importance of understanding the issue context could enhance model insights. For example, \"Consider both the title and description context to determine the bug classification.\" \n\n5. **Guided Examples and Expectations**: To further enhance the prompt\u2019s effectiveness, consider adding information on providing examples or expecting common patterns within issues, such as \"Look for patterns indicating a malfunction.\"\n\n6. **Specificity in Labeling**: While the model is asked to be concise already, emphasizing that the classification should only consider direct evidence of a bug may prevent overgeneralization: \"Label only when clear evidence of malfunction is stated.\"\n\nImplementing these elements has the potential to refine the classification system\u2019s prompt by providing more structured, clear, and domain-focused instructions, thus aiming to boost further improvements in the classification accuracy aligned with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

Establish a clearer protocol for identifying subtleties in ambiguous language. For instance, \"[...] in uncertain contexts, identify any supporting details that inherently signify an actual issue, such as logs or reproducibility steps.\"\n\n3. **Expanding on Positive Non-bug Indicators**: While some non-bug indicators are mentioned, increase emphasis on identifying language that intentionally moves away from problem-focused discourse. For instance, \"[...] recognize language indicating collaborative intent, improvement ambition, or learning, such as 'investigate potential' or 'explore these paths'.\"\n\n4. **Use of Effective Examples**: The prompt includes examples but should focus on subtle nuances and edge cases that have historically led to errors.

Emphasize analyzing ambiguous cases carefully to determine if the issue might be more suggestive of an improvement or discussion rather than a bug.\n\n3. **Highlight Positive Language and Intent**: Reinforce the identification of language focused on improvements, feature requests, and enhancements as indicators of 'non_bug'. Encourage the recognition of language aiming to enhance or add new functionality rather than correcting a failure.\n\n4. **Past Misunderstandings**: Include a suggestion to review specific examples of past classifications, focusing particularly on those where language cues may have led to incorrect predictions.

Consider advising the system to weigh the severity of terms related to malfunction against suggestive terms for improvements, guiding it towards a more integrative approach in understanding user intent.\n\n2. **Explicit Language Patterns**: The current list of bug-related and non_bug indicators is useful. However, expanding it with additional synonyms or related terms that frequently appear in real-world reports could improve accuracy. Encourage the system to use ontologies or thesauri to identify synonyms of key terms and double-check contextual alignment.\n\n3. **Ambiguity Decision Path**: While the guidance to classify ambiguous evidence as 'non_bug' is included, the framework for determining ambiguity could be refined with more concrete guidelines or questions. For instance, suggesting a decision flow-chart or set questions like \"Is the malfunction explicitly stated or inferred?\" could help the system in its decision-making when faced with ambiguity.\n\n4. **Review Process**: Add instructions for the system to periodically self-check previous similar classifications, particularly where the decision was borderline. Incorporating a feedback loop or learning mechanism within the prompt could help mitigate misunderstandings and improve learning.\n\n5. **Misleading Cues**: It may help to expand on how positive language or terms associated with enhancements can be misleading when present in a bug report. Providing brief examples or anecdotes within the prompt for cases where positive language masked the discussion of a malfunction might sharpen the model's ability to distinguish between subtly misleading cues.\n\n6. **Use of Examples**: Including concrete, concise examples within the prompt itself can serve as guidelines, illustrating successful and erroneous classifications. This can especially aid in showing patterns of misinterpretation, reinforcing correct labels with tangible instances.\n\nBy refining these elements, the system prompt could be better equipped to accurately classify issues and reduce the chance of ambiguous cases being incorrectly labeled.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

However, you can incorporate additional clarifications and examples to further reduce ambiguities. Here is a suggested improvement to the prompt:\n\n1. **Explicit Examples**: Include specific examples of 'non_bug' issues to enhance recognition, such as \"Feature requests typically include phrases like 'add', 'implement', 'support', or 'consider enhancing'.\"\n\n2. **Contextual Cues**: Encourage the evaluator to take note of context cues more precisely. For example, \"If the title or description mentions error-related words but is paired with language suggesting a request or idea, consider the overall intent before deciding.\"\n\n3. **Highlight Ambiguities**: Clarify what constitutes ambiguity by stating, \"If the issue includes error-related terms but overall expresses ideas for potential improvements without clear examples of a problem, lean towards 'non_bug'.\"\n\n4. **Common False Indicators**: Offer insights into commonly misinterpreted phrases. For example, \"Phrases like 'explore options' or 'interested in feedback' often point towards 'non_bug' classifications, despite technical terminology.\"\n\nRevised Prompt:\n\"Identify if the issue is a bug or not, based on the title and description\u2014use only 'bug' or 'non_bug'. A 'bug' is indicated by explicit terms like 'error', 'crash', 'unexpected behavior', 'fails', 'malfunction', 'buggy', 'anomaly', or 'defect'. 'Non_bug' issues are often feature requests, enhancements, questions, suggestions, improvements, updates without issues, or discussion proposals. Feature requests commonly use terms like 'add', 'implement', 'support', or 'consider enhancing'. Always consider both title and description together to determine classification, and analyze sentiment, language nuances, and intent signals. If error-related terms are included with language like 'explore options' or 'interested in feedback', the issue might be 'non_bug'. Only label 'bug' when clear, direct evidence of malfunction is present; otherwise, use 'non_bug'. Learn from past classifications to recognize misleading cues, and when in doubt, cite clear examples aligning with non_bug for guidance. Be concise and answer with only the classification label.\" </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the classification system prompt and thereby enhance the system's ability to accurately categorize GitHub issues, the following suggestions can be made:\n\n1. **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: Encourage a more nuanced analysis of context and language in the issue description. The prompt currently instructs to consider context, but elaborating on how evaluators might assess contextual relevance could be useful. You could, for example, provide guidance on recognizing the tone and intent beyond just specific words, such as distinguishing between exploratory language and direct problem statements.\n\n2. **Incorporate More Distinguishing Features**: Expand on the lexical and contextual signals that distinguish 'bug' from 'non_bug'. Currently, specific keywords and phrases are noted, but further categorization of phrases that often lead to misclassification could refine accuracy. For instance, phrases indicating uncertainty or potential for improvement like \"could be improved\" or \"does not currently\" often relate to 'non_bug'.\n\n3. **Directive on Handling Mixed Signals**: Present strategies for dealing with titles or descriptions that include mixed language (bug-related terms alongside non-bug phrasing). Clearly articulate how to prioritize evidence, and provide concrete steps for unpacking issues when conflicting signals are present.\n\n4. **Guidance on Past Classifications as Reference**: Although the prompt mentions learning from past classifications, specifying how to utilize historical data effectively would be beneficial. Outline how patterns can be recognized, with examples of past misclassifications and what led to their correction.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Classification Decision Tree**: Consider a simple decision tree or flowchart within the text or as an accompanying reference to assist in the thought process for classification. A decision tree would help systematically address ambiguities and guide the evaluator through logical decision-making pathways.\n\n6. **Clarity and Conciseness**: While advising evaluators to be concise, ensure the prompt remains direct and clear without overloading them with too much detail. Conciseness is crucial, but not at the cost of missing vital decision-making criteria.\n\nOverall, the combination of examples, clearer guidelines on interpreting mixed signals, and using a structured approach can facilitate improved classification accuracy for issues reported as 'non_bug'.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

However, to further strengthen its ability to identify 'non_bug' issues, consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Include Examples**: Provide a few examples of typical 'non_bug' indicators, such as phrases or terms commonly found in feature requests or discussions.\n\n2. **Clarify Ambiguity Handling**: Emphasize that when language is vague or when it includes terms but lacks details about malfunctions, it's safer to choose 'non_bug'.\n\n3. **Encourage Attention to Details**: Reinforce that hints of a malfunction must be explicit and direct to classify something as a 'bug'. Encourage careful attention to the full context to avoid misclassification.\n\nBy incorporating these enhancements, the prompt may help reduce instances where issues might be unclear but are more consistent with 'non_bug' classifications. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification and better achieve the objective of correctly classifying issues as 'non_bug,' here are some feedback suggestions:\n\n1. **Expand Descriptive Language**: While the prompt mentions several terms that indicate a 'bug,' it could benefit from a broader exploration of language nuances. Consider incorporating examples of language that might disguise itself as a bug, such as ambiguous wording, to better train the system to recognize when something is genuinely not a 'bug'.\n\n2. **Positive vs. Negative Tone**: Currently, the prompt emphasizes language that points toward a malfunction. It may be beneficial to train the system to recognize positive language or constructive feedback typically associated with 'non_bug' reports, such as \"add\", \"enhance\", \"develop\", or \"consider\".\n\n3. **Refine Ambiguity Handling**: The prompt instructs to default to 'non_bug' when evidence is ambiguous, which can be too simplistic. Adding more detail on what constitutes ambiguity and why it usually leads to a 'non_bug' classification could refine decision-making. For instance, specifying scenarios where requests are marked as non-bugs despite using some 'bug' terms might help.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**: It may improve the prompt by urging the system to evaluate the context more holistically, perhaps taking into account the section of the description the terms appear in, or whether the issue is syntactically seeking a resolution suggestive of a bug fix or an enhancement request.\n\n5. **Example Scenarios**: The system could benefit from having explicitly defined example scenarios, both textual and abstract, that differentiate between 'bug' and 'non_bug' issues. Scenarios should include varied linguistic styles found in real issue reports, highlighting how non-bug issues are typically worded, no matter how subtle.\n\n6. **Focus on Intent Signals**: Adding a focus on the intention behind reported issues\u2014whether resolving a symptom of malfunction or suggesting an improvement\u2014can provide another layer for determining the classification as 'non_bug'.\n\n7. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**: The prompt could be improved by incorporating a feedback loop that allows the system to learn from classification mistakes, especially those that have occurred due to subtle misunderstanding of language cues.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, the prompt may more effectively classify issues as 'non_bug', aligning more closely with the intended objective.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

A 'bug' is indicated by explicit terms like \"error\", \"crash\", \"unexpected behavior\", \"fails\", \"malfunction\", \"buggy\", \"anomaly\", or \"defect\". Conversely, 'non_bug' issues might involve feature requests, enhancements, questions, suggestions, improvements, updates without issues, or discussion proposals.

However, to enhance the system's ability to consistently make accurate predictions, consider the following improvements to the prompt:\n\n1. **Emphasize Contextual Analysis**: Add guidance on looking beyond keywords and prioritizing the context in which certain terms are used. For example: \"Analyze whether terms like 'error' or 'crash' are used in hypothetical scenarios or actual malfunction reporting.\"\n\n2. **Highlight Non-bug Indicators**: Strengthen the emphasis on positive language or connotations of improvement and collaboration, such as \"enhancement discussions\", \"seeking advice\", and \"future possibilities\".\n\n3. **Clarify Ambiguity Protocol**: Provide a clearer directive for handling ambiguous situations. For example: \"In cases where terms like 'issue' or 'problem' are used without specifics, classify as 'non_bug' unless accompanied by examples of malfunction.\"\n\n4. **Use Examples More Effectively**: Integrate examples demonstrating subtle distinctions, such as an issue mentioning 'slow performance' as a performance enhancement request rather than a bug.\n\n5. **Include Negative Examples**: Include examples of common errors in previous predictions to highlight situations where misunderstanding occurred, guiding better judgment.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the prompt can better guide the classification system to make nuanced decisions consistently. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification and enhance its performance based on the evaluation provided, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Detailed Analysis of Context Over Keywords**: The prompt currently instructs the model to expand beyond keywords but lacks specific guidance on how to interpret the overall sentiment and language nuances effectively. Explicitly instruct the system to assess the context in which terms appear by providing scenarios where these terms might be misleading. For example, \"[...] consider if terms like 'error' or 'crash' occur in feedback describing expected behavior changes or theoretical discussions, rather than actual malfunctions.\"\n\n2. **Improving Ambiguity Handling**: The prompt suggests defaulting to 'non_bug' in ambiguous situations but does not provide a structured approach for evaluating these cases. Establish a clearer protocol for identifying subtleties in ambiguous language. For instance, \"[...] in uncertain contexts, identify any supporting details that inherently signify an actual issue, such as logs or reproducibility steps.\"\n\n3. **Expanding on Positive Non-bug Indicators**: While some non-bug indicators are mentioned, increase emphasis on identifying language that intentionally moves away from problem-focused discourse. For instance, \"[...] recognize language indicating collaborative intent, improvement ambition, or learning, such as 'investigate potential' or 'explore these paths'.\"\n\n4. **Use of Effective Examples**: The prompt includes examples but should focus on subtle nuances and edge cases that have historically led to errors. Incorporate examples of past misclassifications and clearly annotate why they were incorrect, directing the system to identify these patterns, such as \"[...] note the difference between a description of 'slow resource allocation' in a proposed solution compared to a user's report of 'network lagging due to a bug'.\"\n\n5. **Inclusion of Negative Example Patterns**: Provide insights into common language patterns that previously triggered misclassifications and guide thinking in those scenarios. For example, \"[...] watch for vague problem statements that lack specificity normally associated with 'bug' reports, like 'this might create a confusion'.\"\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the system prompt is further refined to empower the classification model with heightened contextual understanding and reduced reliance on keyword matching, ultimately leading to more accurate predictions.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

However, we can provide feedback to refine and optimize the prompt further for such cases:\n\n1. **Emphasize Context Evaluation**: Encourage the system to deeply evaluate whether the context implies suggestions, feature requests, or general improvements rather than potential malfunctions.\n\n2. **Clarify Ambiguity Handling**: The prompt already advises defaulting to 'non_bug' in ambiguous cases, but adding further clarification could help. For example:\n   - \"In cases where the distinction is subtle and specific terms indicating a bug are absent, prioritize 'non_bug'.\"\n\n3. **Inclusion of Additional Non-Bug Indicators**: Expand the list of 'non_bug' indicators to include more keywords and phrases that suggest improvements or discussions, such as \"would be nice\", \"consider adding\", or \"question about\".\n\n4. **Examples of Non-Bug**: Include brief examples of words or phrases that typically align with non-bug issues to help better discern such instances.\n\nRevised prompt suggestion:\n\"Identify if the issue is a bug or not based on the title and description\u2014use only 'bug' or 'non_bug'.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>1. **Focus on Contextual Understanding**: Encourage the system to use more contextual understanding of the description and title rather than just keyword matching. For example, train the model to recognize patterns of language that typically surround non-bug discussions, even if they don't contain the specific keywords listed.\n\n2. **Explicit Instruction for Learning**: The prompt could more explicitly instruct the system to learn from past classifications, encouraging it to adapt over time by keeping track of patterns that led to correct and incorrect classifications.\n\n3. **Linguistic Nuances**: Expand the emphasis on linguistic nuances. For instance, the system may look for more nuanced expressions that suggest a non-bug nature, such as conditional expressions (\"if only this could\") or speculative language (\"it might be more effective\").\n\n4. **Enhanced Clarity on Ambiguity**: The handling of ambiguity appears important but could be enhanced by stressing how to discern subtle indications of requests rather than errors. This might involve an indication of weighing non-bug indicators more heavily in the absence of direct bug evidence.\n\n5. **Real World Example Inclusion**: Include examples of actual past classifications where ambiguous issues have correctly been labeled as 'non_bug'. Use these examples as anchor points for what the model should identify. This practical application would help in developing a more robust understanding.\n\n6. **Hierarchical Assessment Approach**: Advise the system to take a hierarchy-based approach where it first checks for explicit bug indicators, then looks at non-bug indicators, and finally reviews for potential ambiguities. This layered approach can help in both speed and accuracy.\n\n7. **Sentiment Analysis Component**: Suggest incorporating sentiment analysis to differentiate between user frustration (which might correlate with bugs) and neutral or positive sentiments (suggesting feature enhancements or non-bug discussions).\n\n8. **Phrase Pattern Recognition**: Suggesting the use of regular expressions or pattern recognition for typical non-bug phrases could enhance prompt efficiency. This could include checking for sentence structures common in suggestions or questions reflective of non-bugs.\n\nBy integrating these methodologies, the system prompt can improve its classification performance, reducing misclassifications and enhancing its learning capabilities over time.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For example, emphasizing a more straightforward structure by stating, \"Identify if the issue is a bug or not, based on the title and description\u2014use only 'bug' or 'non_bug'.\"\n\n2. **Explicit Definitions**: Adding a brief definition or criteria for what classifies an issue as a 'bug' versus a 'non_bug' could provide clearer guidance. Including definitions can prevent misclassifications and guide the model even if there are ambiguous cases.\n\n3. **Incorporate Domain-specific Terms**: The prompt could benefit from stating specific language used in bug reporting, such as \"Does the issue include words indicating a malfunction, like 'error', 'crash', or 'fail'?\"\n\n4. **Reinforce Contextual Analysis**: While the prompt currently instructs the model to use the title and description, explicitly reinforcing the importance of understanding the issue context could enhance model insights. For example, \"Consider both the title and description context to determine the bug classification.\" \n\n5. **Guided Examples and Expectations**: To further enhance the prompt\u2019s effectiveness, consider adding information on providing examples or expecting common patterns within issues, such as \"Look for patterns indicating a malfunction.\"\n\n6. **Specificity in Labeling**: While the model is asked to be concise already, emphasizing that the classification should only consider direct evidence of a bug may prevent overgeneralization: \"Label only when clear evidence of malfunction is stated.\"\n\nImplementing these elements has the potential to refine the classification system\u2019s prompt by providing more structured, clear, and domain-focused instructions, thus aiming to boost further improvements in the classification accuracy aligned with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For instance, guiding the system to recognize hedging language or qualifying statements that might obscure the presence of a 'bug' report versus a suggestion could enhance classification accuracy.\n\n2. **Broaden Non-Bug Vocabulary**: The prompt could benefit from an expanded vocabulary that includes more subtle language used in non-bug scenarios. Terms like \"wish to discuss\", \"brainstorm\", \"idea\", or \"feedback\" could help the classifier discern more accurately when an issue isn't a bug.\n\n3. **Explicit Ambiguity Handling Instructions**: Though the default action in the case of ambiguity is mentioned, the current language can be made more assertive or detailed. Consider instructing the system to apply specific decision rules or thresholds beyond which it defaults to 'non_bug', ensuring that less overt linguistic cues are considered more heavily.\n\n4. **Detailed Scenario Examples**: Providing examples of past classifications that were ambiguous but resulted in 'non_bug' labels could stabilize decision-making. These examples could be tied to specific linguistic patterns or scenarios that previously led to effective classification.\n\n5. **Structured Review Mechanism**: Introduce a structured process within the prompt for systematically reviewing both title and description before making a decision.

Consider advising the system to weigh the severity of terms related to malfunction against suggestive terms for improvements, guiding it towards a more integrative approach in understanding user intent.\n\n2. **Explicit Language Patterns**: The current list of bug-related and non_bug indicators is useful. However, expanding it with additional synonyms or related terms that frequently appear in real-world reports could improve accuracy. Encourage the system to use ontologies or thesauri to identify synonyms of key terms and double-check contextual alignment.\n\n3. **Ambiguity Decision Path**: While the guidance to classify ambiguous evidence as 'non_bug' is included, the framework for determining ambiguity could be refined with more concrete guidelines or questions. For instance, suggesting a decision flow-chart or set questions like \"Is the malfunction explicitly stated or inferred?\" could help the system in its decision-making when faced with ambiguity.\n\n4. **Review Process**: Add instructions for the system to periodically self-check previous similar classifications, particularly where the decision was borderline. Incorporating a feedback loop or learning mechanism within the prompt could help mitigate misunderstandings and improve learning.\n\n5. **Misleading Cues**: It may help to expand on how positive language or terms associated with enhancements can be misleading when present in a bug report. Providing brief examples or anecdotes within the prompt for cases where positive language masked the discussion of a malfunction might sharpen the model's ability to distinguish between subtly misleading cues.\n\n6. **Use of Examples**: Including concrete, concise examples within the prompt itself can serve as guidelines, illustrating successful and erroneous classifications. This can especially aid in showing patterns of misinterpretation, reinforcing correct labels with tangible instances.\n\nBy refining these elements, the system prompt could be better equipped to accurately classify issues and reduce the chance of ambiguous cases being incorrectly labeled.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the classification system prompt and thereby enhance the system's ability to accurately categorize GitHub issues, the following suggestions can be made:\n\n1. **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: Encourage a more nuanced analysis of context and language in the issue description. The prompt currently instructs to consider context, but elaborating on how evaluators might assess contextual relevance could be useful. You could, for example, provide guidance on recognizing the tone and intent beyond just specific words, such as distinguishing between exploratory language and direct problem statements.\n\n2. **Incorporate More Distinguishing Features**: Expand on the lexical and contextual signals that distinguish 'bug' from 'non_bug'. Currently, specific keywords and phrases are noted, but further categorization of phrases that often lead to misclassification could refine accuracy. For instance, phrases indicating uncertainty or potential for improvement like \"could be improved\" or \"does not currently\" often relate to 'non_bug'.\n\n3. **Directive on Handling Mixed Signals**: Present strategies for dealing with titles or descriptions that include mixed language (bug-related terms alongside non-bug phrasing). Clearly articulate how to prioritize evidence, and provide concrete steps for unpacking issues when conflicting signals are present.\n\n4. **Guidance on Past Classifications as Reference**: Although the prompt mentions learning from past classifications, specifying how to utilize historical data effectively would be beneficial. Outline how patterns can be recognized, with examples of past misclassifications and what led to their correction.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Classification Decision Tree**: Consider a simple decision tree or flowchart within the text or as an accompanying reference to assist in the thought process for classification. A decision tree would help systematically address ambiguities and guide the evaluator through logical decision-making pathways.\n\n6. **Clarity and Conciseness**: While advising evaluators to be concise, ensure the prompt remains direct and clear without overloading them with too much detail. Conciseness is crucial, but not at the cost of missing vital decision-making criteria.\n\nOverall, the combination of examples, clearer guidelines on interpreting mixed signals, and using a structured approach can facilitate improved classification accuracy for issues reported as 'non_bug'.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

Encourage careful attention to the full context to avoid misclassification.\n\nBy incorporating these enhancements, the prompt may help reduce instances where issues might be unclear but are more consistent with 'non_bug' classifications. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification and better achieve the objective of correctly classifying issues as 'non_bug,' here are some feedback suggestions:\n\n1. **Expand Descriptive Language**: While the prompt mentions several terms that indicate a 'bug,' it could benefit from a broader exploration of language nuances. Consider incorporating examples of language that might disguise itself as a bug, such as ambiguous wording, to better train the system to recognize when something is genuinely not a 'bug'.\n\n2. **Positive vs. Negative Tone**: Currently, the prompt emphasizes language that points toward a malfunction. It may be beneficial to train the system to recognize positive language or constructive feedback typically associated with 'non_bug' reports, such as \"add\", \"enhance\", \"develop\", or \"consider\".\n\n3. **Refine Ambiguity Handling**: The prompt instructs to default to 'non_bug' when evidence is ambiguous, which can be too simplistic. Adding more detail on what constitutes ambiguity and why it usually leads to a 'non_bug' classification could refine decision-making. For instance, specifying scenarios where requests are marked as non-bugs despite using some 'bug' terms might help.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**: It may improve the prompt by urging the system to evaluate the context more holistically, perhaps taking into account the section of the description the terms appear in, or whether the issue is syntactically seeking a resolution suggestive of a bug fix or an enhancement request.\n\n5. **Example Scenarios**: The system could benefit from having explicitly defined example scenarios, both textual and abstract, that differentiate between 'bug' and 'non_bug' issues. Scenarios should include varied linguistic styles found in real issue reports, highlighting how non-bug issues are typically worded, no matter how subtle.\n\n6. **Focus on Intent Signals**: Adding a focus on the intention behind reported issues\u2014whether resolving a symptom of malfunction or suggesting an improvement\u2014can provide another layer for determining the classification as 'non_bug'.\n\n7. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**: The prompt could be improved by incorporating a feedback loop that allows the system to learn from classification mistakes, especially those that have occurred due to subtle misunderstanding of language cues.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, the prompt may more effectively classify issues as 'non_bug', aligning more closely with the intended objective.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For instance, guiding the system to recognize hedging language or qualifying statements that might obscure the presence of a 'bug' report versus a suggestion could enhance classification accuracy.\n\n2. **Broaden Non-Bug Vocabulary**: The prompt could benefit from an expanded vocabulary that includes more subtle language used in non-bug scenarios. Terms like \"wish to discuss\", \"brainstorm\", \"idea\", or \"feedback\" could help the classifier discern more accurately when an issue isn't a bug.\n\n3. **Explicit Ambiguity Handling Instructions**: Though the default action in the case of ambiguity is mentioned, the current language can be made more assertive or detailed. Consider instructing the system to apply specific decision rules or thresholds beyond which it defaults to 'non_bug', ensuring that less overt linguistic cues are considered more heavily.\n\n4. **Detailed Scenario Examples**: Providing examples of past classifications that were ambiguous but resulted in 'non_bug' labels could stabilize decision-making. These examples could be tied to specific linguistic patterns or scenarios that previously led to effective classification.\n\n5. **Structured Review Mechanism**: Introduce a structured process within the prompt for systematically reviewing both title and description before making a decision. This can reduce over-reliance on single keywords and improve overall consistency.\n\n6. **Bias Mitigation Against Over-Classification**: Emphasize a balanced approach whereby the prompt ensures it doesn't aggressively default to 'non_bug' when it's reasonably probable that a bug-related concept is merely written in a non-explicit manner.\n\n7. **Refinement Through Iterative Learning**: Integrate language on incorporating feedback from previous errors where 'non_bug' was mistakenly labeled and specify adjustments in criteria that were used successfully in past analysis.\n\nBy integrating these improvements, the system prompt can better address ambiguity, improve contextual interpretation, and enhance the classification process for non-bug reports, aligning closely with the goal of consistently accurate classifications.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For example: \"Analyze whether terms like 'error' or 'crash' are used in hypothetical scenarios or actual malfunction reporting.\"\n\n2. **Highlight Non-bug Indicators**: Strengthen the emphasis on positive language or connotations of improvement and collaboration, such as \"enhancement discussions\", \"seeking advice\", and \"future possibilities\".\n\n3. **Clarify Ambiguity Protocol**: Provide a clearer directive for handling ambiguous situations. For example: \"In cases where terms like 'issue' or 'problem' are used without specifics, classify as 'non_bug' unless accompanied by examples of malfunction.\"\n\n4. **Use Examples More Effectively**: Integrate examples demonstrating subtle distinctions, such as an issue mentioning 'slow performance' as a performance enhancement request rather than a bug.\n\n5. **Include Negative Examples**: Include examples of common errors in previous predictions to highlight situations where misunderstanding occurred, guiding better judgment.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the prompt can better guide the classification system to make nuanced decisions consistently. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification and enhance its performance based on the evaluation provided, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Detailed Analysis of Context Over Keywords**: The prompt currently instructs the model to expand beyond keywords but lacks specific guidance on how to interpret the overall sentiment and language nuances effectively. Explicitly instruct the system to assess the context in which terms appear by providing scenarios where these terms might be misleading. For example, \"[...] consider if terms like 'error' or 'crash' occur in feedback describing expected behavior changes or theoretical discussions, rather than actual malfunctions.\"\n\n2. **Improving Ambiguity Handling**: The prompt suggests defaulting to 'non_bug' in ambiguous situations but does not provide a structured approach for evaluating these cases. Establish a clearer protocol for identifying subtleties in ambiguous language. For instance, \"[...] in uncertain contexts, identify any supporting details that inherently signify an actual issue, such as logs or reproducibility steps.\"\n\n3. **Expanding on Positive Non-bug Indicators**: While some non-bug indicators are mentioned, increase emphasis on identifying language that intentionally moves away from problem-focused discourse. For instance, \"[...] recognize language indicating collaborative intent, improvement ambition, or learning, such as 'investigate potential' or 'explore these paths'.\"\n\n4. **Use of Effective Examples**: The prompt includes examples but should focus on subtle nuances and edge cases that have historically led to errors. Incorporate examples of past misclassifications and clearly annotate why they were incorrect, directing the system to identify these patterns, such as \"[...] note the difference between a description of 'slow resource allocation' in a proposed solution compared to a user's report of 'network lagging due to a bug'.\"\n\n5. **Inclusion of Negative Example Patterns**: Provide insights into common language patterns that previously triggered misclassifications and guide thinking in those scenarios. For example, \"[...] watch for vague problem statements that lack specificity normally associated with 'bug' reports, like 'this might create a confusion'.\"\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the system prompt is further refined to empower the classification model with heightened contextual understanding and reduced reliance on keyword matching, ultimately leading to more accurate predictions.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For example, train the model to recognize patterns of language that typically surround non-bug discussions, even if they don't contain the specific keywords listed.\n\n2. **Explicit Instruction for Learning**: The prompt could more explicitly instruct the system to learn from past classifications, encouraging it to adapt over time by keeping track of patterns that led to correct and incorrect classifications.\n\n3. **Linguistic Nuances**: Expand the emphasis on linguistic nuances. For instance, the system may look for more nuanced expressions that suggest a non-bug nature, such as conditional expressions (\"if only this could\") or speculative language (\"it might be more effective\").\n\n4. **Enhanced Clarity on Ambiguity**: The handling of ambiguity appears important but could be enhanced by stressing how to discern subtle indications of requests rather than errors. This might involve an indication of weighing non-bug indicators more heavily in the absence of direct bug evidence.\n\n5. **Real World Example Inclusion**: Include examples of actual past classifications where ambiguous issues have correctly been labeled as 'non_bug'. Use these examples as anchor points for what the model should identify. This practical application would help in developing a more robust understanding.\n\n6. **Hierarchical Assessment Approach**: Advise the system to take a hierarchy-based approach where it first checks for explicit bug indicators, then looks at non-bug indicators, and finally reviews for potential ambiguities. This layered approach can help in both speed and accuracy.\n\n7. **Sentiment Analysis Component**: Suggest incorporating sentiment analysis to differentiate between user frustration (which might correlate with bugs) and neutral or positive sentiments (suggesting feature enhancements or non-bug discussions).\n\n8. **Phrase Pattern Recognition**: Suggesting the use of regular expressions or pattern recognition for typical non-bug phrases could enhance prompt efficiency. This could include checking for sentence structures common in suggestions or questions reflective of non-bugs.\n\nBy integrating these methodologies, the system prompt can improve its classification performance, reducing misclassifications and enhancing its learning capabilities over time.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For example, emphasizing a more straightforward structure by stating, \"Identify if the issue is a bug or not, based on the title and description\u2014use only 'bug' or 'non_bug'.\"\n\n2. **Explicit Definitions**: Adding a brief definition or criteria for what classifies an issue as a 'bug' versus a 'non_bug' could provide clearer guidance. Including definitions can prevent misclassifications and guide the model even if there are ambiguous cases.\n\n3. **Incorporate Domain-specific Terms**: The prompt could benefit from stating specific language used in bug reporting, such as \"Does the issue include words indicating a malfunction, like 'error', 'crash', or 'fail'?\"\n\n4. **Reinforce Contextual Analysis**: While the prompt currently instructs the model to use the title and description, explicitly reinforcing the importance of understanding the issue context could enhance model insights. For example, \"Consider both the title and description context to determine the bug classification.\" \n\n5. **Guided Examples and Expectations**: To further enhance the prompt\u2019s effectiveness, consider adding information on providing examples or expecting common patterns within issues, such as \"Look for patterns indicating a malfunction.\"\n\n6. **Specificity in Labeling**: While the model is asked to be concise already, emphasizing that the classification should only consider direct evidence of a bug may prevent overgeneralization: \"Label only when clear evidence of malfunction is stated.\"\n\nImplementing these elements has the potential to refine the classification system\u2019s prompt by providing more structured, clear, and domain-focused instructions, thus aiming to boost further improvements in the classification accuracy aligned with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>1. **Contextual Emphasis**: The prompt already suggests using a holistic contextual analysis, but it could benefit from clearer articulation on how to balance the title and description. Consider advising the system to weigh the severity of terms related to malfunction against suggestive terms for improvements, guiding it towards a more integrative approach in understanding user intent.\n\n2. **Explicit Language Patterns**: The current list of bug-related and non_bug indicators is useful. However, expanding it with additional synonyms or related terms that frequently appear in real-world reports could improve accuracy. Encourage the system to use ontologies or thesauri to identify synonyms of key terms and double-check contextual alignment.\n\n3. **Ambiguity Decision Path**: While the guidance to classify ambiguous evidence as 'non_bug' is included, the framework for determining ambiguity could be refined with more concrete guidelines or questions. For instance, suggesting a decision flow-chart or set questions like \"Is the malfunction explicitly stated or inferred?\" could help the system in its decision-making when faced with ambiguity.\n\n4. **Review Process**: Add instructions for the system to periodically self-check previous similar classifications, particularly where the decision was borderline. Incorporating a feedback loop or learning mechanism within the prompt could help mitigate misunderstandings and improve learning.\n\n5. **Misleading Cues**: It may help to expand on how positive language or terms associated with enhancements can be misleading when present in a bug report. Providing brief examples or anecdotes within the prompt for cases where positive language masked the discussion of a malfunction might sharpen the model's ability to distinguish between subtly misleading cues.\n\n6. **Use of Examples**: Including concrete, concise examples within the prompt itself can serve as guidelines, illustrating successful and erroneous classifications. This can especially aid in showing patterns of misinterpretation, reinforcing correct labels with tangible instances.\n\nBy refining these elements, the system prompt could be better equipped to accurately classify issues and reduce the chance of ambiguous cases being incorrectly labeled.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For example, \"If the title or description mentions error-related words but is paired with language suggesting a request or idea, consider the overall intent before deciding.\"\n\n3. **Highlight Ambiguities**: Clarify what constitutes ambiguity by stating, \"If the issue includes error-related terms but overall expresses ideas for potential improvements without clear examples of a problem, lean towards 'non_bug'.\"\n\n4. **Common False Indicators**: Offer insights into commonly misinterpreted phrases. For example, \"Phrases like 'explore options' or 'interested in feedback' often point towards 'non_bug' classifications, despite technical terminology.\"\n\nRevised Prompt:\n\"Identify if the issue is a bug or not, based on the title and description\u2014use only 'bug' or 'non_bug'.

'Non_bug' issues are often feature requests, enhancements, questions, suggestions, improvements, updates without issues, or discussion proposals. Feature requests commonly use terms like 'add', 'implement', 'support', or 'consider enhancing'. Always consider both title and description together to determine classification, and analyze sentiment, language nuances, and intent signals. If error-related terms are included with language like 'explore options' or 'interested in feedback', the issue might be 'non_bug'. Only label 'bug' when clear, direct evidence of malfunction is present; otherwise, use 'non_bug'. Learn from past classifications to recognize misleading cues, and when in doubt, cite clear examples aligning with non_bug for guidance.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the classification system prompt and thereby enhance the system's ability to accurately categorize GitHub issues, the following suggestions can be made:\n\n1. **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: Encourage a more nuanced analysis of context and language in the issue description. The prompt currently instructs to consider context, but elaborating on how evaluators might assess contextual relevance could be useful. You could, for example, provide guidance on recognizing the tone and intent beyond just specific words, such as distinguishing between exploratory language and direct problem statements.\n\n2. **Incorporate More Distinguishing Features**: Expand on the lexical and contextual signals that distinguish 'bug' from 'non_bug'. Currently, specific keywords and phrases are noted, but further categorization of phrases that often lead to misclassification could refine accuracy. For instance, phrases indicating uncertainty or potential for improvement like \"could be improved\" or \"does not currently\" often relate to 'non_bug'.\n\n3. **Directive on Handling Mixed Signals**: Present strategies for dealing with titles or descriptions that include mixed language (bug-related terms alongside non-bug phrasing). Clearly articulate how to prioritize evidence, and provide concrete steps for unpacking issues when conflicting signals are present.\n\n4. **Guidance on Past Classifications as Reference**: Although the prompt mentions learning from past classifications, specifying how to utilize historical data effectively would be beneficial. Outline how patterns can be recognized, with examples of past misclassifications and what led to their correction.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Classification Decision Tree**: Consider a simple decision tree or flowchart within the text or as an accompanying reference to assist in the thought process for classification. A decision tree would help systematically address ambiguities and guide the evaluator through logical decision-making pathways.\n\n6. **Clarity and Conciseness**: While advising evaluators to be concise, ensure the prompt remains direct and clear without overloading them with too much detail. Conciseness is crucial, but not at the cost of missing vital decision-making criteria.\n\nOverall, the combination of examples, clearer guidelines on interpreting mixed signals, and using a structured approach can facilitate improved classification accuracy for issues reported as 'non_bug'.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

However, to further strengthen its ability to identify 'non_bug' issues, consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Include Examples**: Provide a few examples of typical 'non_bug' indicators, such as phrases or terms commonly found in feature requests or discussions.\n\n2. **Clarify Ambiguity Handling**: Emphasize that when language is vague or when it includes terms but lacks details about malfunctions, it's safer to choose 'non_bug'.\n\n3. **Encourage Attention to Details**: Reinforce that hints of a malfunction must be explicit and direct to classify something as a 'bug'. Encourage careful attention to the full context to avoid misclassification.\n\nBy incorporating these enhancements, the prompt may help reduce instances where issues might be unclear but are more consistent with 'non_bug' classifications. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification and better achieve the objective of correctly classifying issues as 'non_bug,' here are some feedback suggestions:\n\n1. **Expand Descriptive Language**: While the prompt mentions several terms that indicate a 'bug,' it could benefit from a broader exploration of language nuances. Consider incorporating examples of language that might disguise itself as a bug, such as ambiguous wording, to better train the system to recognize when something is genuinely not a 'bug'.\n\n2. **Positive vs. Negative Tone**: Currently, the prompt emphasizes language that points toward a malfunction. It may be beneficial to train the system to recognize positive language or constructive feedback typically associated with 'non_bug' reports, such as \"add\", \"enhance\", \"develop\", or \"consider\".\n\n3. **Refine Ambiguity Handling**: The prompt instructs to default to 'non_bug' when evidence is ambiguous, which can be too simplistic. Adding more detail on what constitutes ambiguity and why it usually leads to a 'non_bug' classification could refine decision-making. For instance, specifying scenarios where requests are marked as non-bugs despite using some 'bug' terms might help.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis**: It may improve the prompt by urging the system to evaluate the context more holistically, perhaps taking into account the section of the description the terms appear in, or whether the issue is syntactically seeking a resolution suggestive of a bug fix or an enhancement request.\n\n5. **Example Scenarios**: The system could benefit from having explicitly defined example scenarios, both textual and abstract, that differentiate between 'bug' and 'non_bug' issues. Scenarios should include varied linguistic styles found in real issue reports, highlighting how non-bug issues are typically worded, no matter how subtle.\n\n6. **Focus on Intent Signals**: Adding a focus on the intention behind reported issues\u2014whether resolving a symptom of malfunction or suggesting an improvement\u2014can provide another layer for determining the classification as 'non_bug'.\n\n7. **Feedback Loop Mechanism**: The prompt could be improved by incorporating a feedback loop that allows the system to learn from classification mistakes, especially those that have occurred due to subtle misunderstanding of language cues.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, the prompt may more effectively classify issues as 'non_bug', aligning more closely with the intended objective.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For instance, guiding the system to recognize hedging language or qualifying statements that might obscure the presence of a 'bug' report versus a suggestion could enhance classification accuracy.\n\n2. **Broaden Non-Bug Vocabulary**: The prompt could benefit from an expanded vocabulary that includes more subtle language used in non-bug scenarios. Terms like \"wish to discuss\", \"brainstorm\", \"idea\", or \"feedback\" could help the classifier discern more accurately when an issue isn't a bug.\n\n3. **Explicit Ambiguity Handling Instructions**: Though the default action in the case of ambiguity is mentioned, the current language can be made more assertive or detailed. Consider instructing the system to apply specific decision rules or thresholds beyond which it defaults to 'non_bug', ensuring that less overt linguistic cues are considered more heavily.\n\n4. **Detailed Scenario Examples**: Providing examples of past classifications that were ambiguous but resulted in 'non_bug' labels could stabilize decision-making. These examples could be tied to specific linguistic patterns or scenarios that previously led to effective classification.\n\n5. **Structured Review Mechanism**: Introduce a structured process within the prompt for systematically reviewing both title and description before making a decision. This can reduce over-reliance on single keywords and improve overall consistency.\n\n6. **Bias Mitigation Against Over-Classification**: Emphasize a balanced approach whereby the prompt ensures it doesn't aggressively default to 'non_bug' when it's reasonably probable that a bug-related concept is merely written in a non-explicit manner.\n\n7. **Refinement Through Iterative Learning**: Integrate language on incorporating feedback from previous errors where 'non_bug' was mistakenly labeled and specify adjustments in criteria that were used successfully in past analysis.\n\nBy integrating these improvements, the system prompt can better address ambiguity, improve contextual interpretation, and enhance the classification process for non-bug reports, aligning closely with the goal of consistently accurate classifications.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For example: \"Analyze whether terms like 'error' or 'crash' are used in hypothetical scenarios or actual malfunction reporting.\"\n\n2. **Highlight Non-bug Indicators**: Strengthen the emphasis on positive language or connotations of improvement and collaboration, such as \"enhancement discussions\", \"seeking advice\", and \"future possibilities\".\n\n3. **Clarify Ambiguity Protocol**: Provide a clearer directive for handling ambiguous situations. For example: \"In cases where terms like 'issue' or 'problem' are used without specifics, classify as 'non_bug' unless accompanied by examples of malfunction.\"\n\n4. **Use Examples More Effectively**: Integrate examples demonstrating subtle distinctions, such as an issue mentioning 'slow performance' as a performance enhancement request rather than a bug.\n\n5. **Include Negative Examples**: Include examples of common errors in previous predictions to highlight situations where misunderstanding occurred, guiding better judgment.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the prompt can better guide the classification system to make nuanced decisions consistently. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification and enhance its performance based on the evaluation provided, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Detailed Analysis of Context Over Keywords**: The prompt currently instructs the model to expand beyond keywords but lacks specific guidance on how to interpret the overall sentiment and language nuances effectively. Explicitly instruct the system to assess the context in which terms appear by providing scenarios where these terms might be misleading. For example, \"[...] consider if terms like 'error' or 'crash' occur in feedback describing expected behavior changes or theoretical discussions, rather than actual malfunctions.\"\n\n2. **Improving Ambiguity Handling**: The prompt suggests defaulting to 'non_bug' in ambiguous situations but does not provide a structured approach for evaluating these cases. Establish a clearer protocol for identifying subtleties in ambiguous language. For instance, \"[...] in uncertain contexts, identify any supporting details that inherently signify an actual issue, such as logs or reproducibility steps.\"\n\n3. **Expanding on Positive Non-bug Indicators**: While some non-bug indicators are mentioned, increase emphasis on identifying language that intentionally moves away from problem-focused discourse. For instance, \"[...] recognize language indicating collaborative intent, improvement ambition, or learning, such as 'investigate potential' or 'explore these paths'.\"\n\n4. **Use of Effective Examples**: The prompt includes examples but should focus on subtle nuances and edge cases that have historically led to errors. Incorporate examples of past misclassifications and clearly annotate why they were incorrect, directing the system to identify these patterns, such as \"[...] note the difference between a description of 'slow resource allocation' in a proposed solution compared to a user's report of 'network lagging due to a bug'.\"\n\n5. **Inclusion of Negative Example Patterns**: Provide insights into common language patterns that previously triggered misclassifications and guide thinking in those scenarios. For example, \"[...] watch for vague problem statements that lack specificity normally associated with 'bug' reports, like 'this might create a confusion'.\"\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the system prompt is further refined to empower the classification model with heightened contextual understanding and reduced reliance on keyword matching, ultimately leading to more accurate predictions.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For example, train the model to recognize patterns of language that typically surround non-bug discussions, even if they don't contain the specific keywords listed.\n\n2. **Explicit Instruction for Learning**: The prompt could more explicitly instruct the system to learn from past classifications, encouraging it to adapt over time by keeping track of patterns that led to correct and incorrect classifications.\n\n3. **Linguistic Nuances**: Expand the emphasis on linguistic nuances. For instance, the system may look for more nuanced expressions that suggest a non-bug nature, such as conditional expressions (\"if only this could\") or speculative language (\"it might be more effective\").\n\n4. **Enhanced Clarity on Ambiguity**: The handling of ambiguity appears important but could be enhanced by stressing how to discern subtle indications of requests rather than errors. This might involve an indication of weighing non-bug indicators more heavily in the absence of direct bug evidence.\n\n5. **Real World Example Inclusion**: Include examples of actual past classifications where ambiguous issues have correctly been labeled as 'non_bug'. Use these examples as anchor points for what the model should identify. This practical application would help in developing a more robust understanding.\n\n6. **Hierarchical Assessment Approach**: Advise the system to take a hierarchy-based approach where it first checks for explicit bug indicators, then looks at non-bug indicators, and finally reviews for potential ambiguities. This layered approach can help in both speed and accuracy.\n\n7. **Sentiment Analysis Component**: Suggest incorporating sentiment analysis to differentiate between user frustration (which might correlate with bugs) and neutral or positive sentiments (suggesting feature enhancements or non-bug discussions).\n\n8. **Phrase Pattern Recognition**: Suggesting the use of regular expressions or pattern recognition for typical non-bug phrases could enhance prompt efficiency.

Add specific examples of ambiguous scenarios to guide the classification.\n\n2. **Strengthen Contextual Analysis Instructions**: Encourage the system to weigh the overall context where indirect bug references exist but the predominant content involves suggestions or improvements. The prompt should instruct the system to prioritize the broader theme over isolated mentions of bug-like language.\n\n3. **Emphasize Explicitness in Malfunction Recognition**: Reinforce the rule that without explicit confirmation of a malfunction, even in the presence of terms typically associated with bugs, the issue should be classified as 'non_bug'. This guidance should state that the presence of certain keywords alone is not enough for classification as 'bug' unless there is a clear report of a malfunction.\n\n4. **Provide Concrete Examples**: The inclusion of specific examples illustrating ambiguity and examples of correctly classified historical patterns can help the model learn to differentiate between subtle language nuances.

However, to reinforce the accuracy of such classifications in future cases, the prompt could be enhanced to incorporate clearer definitions or examples of both 'bug' and 'non_bug' scenarios. Here are some suggested changes:\n\n1. **Include Additional Context for 'non_bug':** Add examples or keywords that could indicate a 'non_bug' issue, such as \"feature request\", \"enhancement\", \"question\", or \"suggestion\".\n\n2. **Clarify 'non_bug' Scenarios:** Highlight that issues focusing on improvements, discussions, or clarifications without evidence of malfunction are likely 'non_bug'.\n\nHere\u2019s an improved version of the prompt:\n\n---\n\nIdentify if the issue is a bug or not based on the title and description\u2014use only 'bug' or 'non_bug'. A 'bug' is indicated by explicit terms like \"error\", \"crash\", \"unexpected behavior\", or \"fails\". Consider both the title and description context to arrive at your classification. 'Non_bug' should be chosen for feature requests, enhancements, or questions where no malfunction is described. Label only when clear evidence of malfunction is stated. Be concise and answer with only the classification label. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the classification system's prompt and consequently enhance its performance, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Expand Keyword Recognition for 'bug':** While the prompt already includes some terms that indicate a bug, expanding this list can reduce ambiguity. Consider including synonyms or related phrases like \"malfunction,\" \"buggy,\" \"anomaly,\" and \"defect.\"\n\n2. **Define 'non_bug' More Explicitly:** Incorporate examples or descriptors that distinctly classify what constitutes a 'non_bug' issue. As suggested, terms like \"feature request,\" \"improvement,\" \"update without issues,\" or \"discussion proposal\" can provide clarity.\n\n3. **Example-Based Learning:** Integrate short, illustrative examples within the prompt that depict common scenarios of both 'bug' and 'non_bug' classifications. This could serve as a more tangible guide for classification.\n\n4. **Encourage Multi-Factor Evaluation:** Encourage the system to consider the overall sentiment and language nuances within the title and description rather than relying solely on explicit keywords. This can improve classification in cases where users express malfunctions indirectly.\n\n5. **Emphasize Contextual Understanding:** Stress the importance of contextual comprehension. Suggest the system evaluate how terms are used in context\u2014for instance, whether \"error\" appears in the context of a question (which could be 'non_bug') versus as evidence of malfunction.\n\n6. **State Ambiguity Handling:** Guide the system on how to handle ambiguous cases where evidence of a bug isn\u2019t clear-cut, perhaps defaulting to 'non_bug' unless the presence of a bug is strongly indicated.\n\nIncorporating these feedback points could bolster the system's ability to accurately classify issues more consistently, thereby aligning better with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (system prompt for classification) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}
