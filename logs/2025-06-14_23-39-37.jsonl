Reminding the system to give more weight to the presence of detailed technical information or error messages, which are more indicative of bug reports.\n\nHere's a revised prompt emphasizing these points:\n\n\"You are a software engineering assistant that identifies bug reports in GitHub issues. Focus on language indicative of bugs, such as 'error,' 'fails,' 'unexpected,' or 'crash,' while evaluating contextual cues like steps to reproduce or comparisons of expected and actual behavior.

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification and enhance its ability to consistently classify GitHub issues accurately as \"bug\" or \"non_bug,\" consider the following feedback strategies:\n\n1. **Incorporate Example-based Guidance:**\n   - Adding explicit examples of bug and non-bug reports within the prompt can provide clearer guidelines for the classification task. This could help the assistant better differentiate between common language found in bug reports versus other types of issues.\n\n2. **Clarify the Scope of Assessment:**\n   - Specify within the prompt that the classification should factor in the presence, absence, or relevance of technical jargon, specific error codes, or system-specific terminology that are typical in bug reports. This specificity can guide the assistant to look for particular content that more reliably indicates a bug.\n\n3. **Emphasize the Contextual Evaluation:**\n   - Encourage the assistant to evaluate not just the explicit language but also the context provided by the description. Clarifying that the presence of steps to reproduce, specific conditions under which an issue arises, and any discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes, are integral to making a judgment can guide the assistant more effectively.\n\n4. **Nuance in Language Indicators:**\n   - Rather than just focusing on words like \"error\" or \"crash,\" which can appear in non-bug contexts as well, suggest analyzing the sentence structure and surrounding phrases to discern whether they describe a problem in functionality or usage as opposed to a request for improvement or a general inquiry.\n\n5. **Mitigate Ambiguity:**\n   - Address potential ambiguities by defining what constitutes a borderline case and how the system should handle uncertainties in phrasing that might not be directly indicative of a bug. This helps in refining the decision-making process in ambiguous scenarios.\n\n6. **Set Prioritization Cues:**\n   - Include a directive to prioritize information that aligns with known bug-reporting templates, potentially using pattern recognition or textual markers that are rich indicators of bugs rather than user experience descriptions or feature suggestions.\n\nBy incorporating these feedback strategies, the system prompt can become more precise in directing the assistant's focus and improve the likelihood of accurate classifications across different instances.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification and enhance its ability to consistently classify GitHub issues accurately as \"bug\" or \"non_bug,\" consider the following feedback strategies:\n\n1. **Incorporate Example-based Guidance:**\n   - Adding explicit examples of bug and non-bug reports within the prompt can provide clearer guidelines for the classification task. This could help the assistant better differentiate between common language found in bug reports versus other types of issues.\n\n2. **Clarify the Scope of Assessment:**\n   - Specify within the prompt that the classification should factor in the presence, absence, or relevance of technical jargon, specific error codes, or system-specific terminology that are typical in bug reports. This specificity can guide the assistant to look for particular content that more reliably indicates a bug.\n\n3. **Emphasize the Contextual Evaluation:**\n   - Encourage the assistant to evaluate not just the explicit language but also the context provided by the description. Clarifying that the presence of steps to reproduce, specific conditions under which an issue arises, and any discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes, are integral to making a judgment can guide the assistant more effectively.\n\n4. **Nuance in Language Indicators:**\n   - Rather than just focusing on words like \"error\" or \"crash,\" which can appear in non-bug contexts as well, suggest analyzing the sentence structure and surrounding phrases to discern whether they describe a problem in functionality or usage as opposed to a request for improvement or a general inquiry.\n\n5. **Mitigate Ambiguity:**\n   - Address potential ambiguities by defining what constitutes a borderline case and how the system should handle uncertainties in phrasing that might not be directly indicative of a bug. This helps in refining the decision-making process in ambiguous scenarios.\n\n6. **Set Prioritization Cues:**\n   - Include a directive to prioritize information that aligns with known bug-reporting templates, potentially using pattern recognition or textual markers that are rich indicators of bugs rather than user experience descriptions or feature suggestions.\n\nBy incorporating these feedback strategies, the system prompt can become more precise in directing the assistant's focus and improve the likelihood of accurate classifications across different instances.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

Consider sentence structure and surrounding phrases to understand whether they describe a genuine functional problem.\n\n2. **Evaluate Technical Details**: Pay attention to technical jargon, error codes, and system-specific terminology, which often signal bug reports. Note if steps to reproduce, specific conditions of failure, or expected versus actual results are mentioned.\n\n3. **Consider Examples**: Think of common examples of bug reports including descriptions of malfunctions, errors during usage, and detailed reproduction steps.

Therefore, classify it as \"non_bug\" due to insufficient evidence to indicate a bug.\n\n2. **Detect Insufficient Context**: If the information about the issue is missing or incomplete, prioritize classifying it as \"non_bug\" unless clear bug-related terms or descriptions are given when available.\n\nThese enhancements will help guide the system to make an appropriate classification when dealing with incomplete or minimally informative inputs. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>1. **Include Default Assumptions for Missing Data**: The current prompt does not address scenarios where the issue title and description are absent or too vague. By specifying that in the absence of detailed information, the default classification should lean towards \"non_bug,\" the system can handle inputs with minimal information more effectively, avoiding a default error response.\n\n2. **Clarify Contextual Cues for 'non_bug' Classification**: Enhance the guidelines by emphasizing the importance of lack of action verbs, technical details, or descriptions typically associated with bugs in making a 'non_bug' classification. This can include mentions of feature requests, general suggestions, or discussions which often do not involve urgent functional problems.\n\n3. **Integrate Example Analysis**: Modify the third guideline to emphasize analyzing typical examples of non-bug issues. This could include generic discussion topics, improvement ideas, or knowledge exchange, which lack signs of system malfunction. Providing contrasting examples of bugs and non-bugs can help sharpen the model's ability to distinguish between them.\n\n4. **Incorporate Decision-Making Heuristics for Ambiguity**: Under \"Handle Ambiguity,\" specify heuristic strategies like looking for explicit question marks or open-ended language that typically indicate non-bug reports. This could refine the model's capabilities in borderline or ambiguous cases.\n\n5. **Reinforce the Importance of Complete Descriptions**: Stress that a complete bug report typically includes specific details, and their absence usually suggests a non-bug scenario. Encourage the model to expect comprehensive problem descriptions for the \"bug\" classification, training it to rely not solely on isolated indicators.\n\n6. **Prompt Structure Refinement**: Simplify and organize the structure of guidelines with clear section headings or numbered steps to guide the model's decision tree more effectively. Shorter, precise instructions can aid in quick pattern recognition and improve classification accuracy.\n\nThese enhancements aim to address the issue of processing incomplete inputs and to improve the system's accuracy in distinguishing between 'bug' and 'non_bug' classifications.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nHere is a GitHub issue report:\nTitle: \"{title}\"\nDescription: \"{body}\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?
