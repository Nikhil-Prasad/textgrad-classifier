The idea being \"our\" react app has its javascript loaded in an iframe, but the \"main\" window hosts dom elements from the customers and our react app. That bit works fine. As time goes on \"our\" react UI is no longer needed, and then react root is removed, and the iframe destroyed. These apps are often long lived so there will be times when the react app needs to appear again, and the iframe is recreated and everything reloaded. This can and will happen many times.\n\n_Goal_\nWe would like to NOT keep the iframe around when its not actually needed, but rather re-create just in time when it is needed. This app is used by customers and they would like to embed our \"react\" app, without interference with their \"app\" and all its javascript, which is why we are doing the iframe thing.\n\n_Problem_\nIt is evident by watching the chrome dev tools \"timeline\" memory graph that memory always increases each time a new iframe is created and the react UI is init'd. Unmounting and destroying the iframe, never causes the memory to drop to \"near\" original before load value. Repeating this process multiple times slowly show an increase memory.\n\nThis also causes a more immediate problem, in that react is throwing exceptions on every event (click, type etc) because the window of the iframe is now null.\n\n_Proof: First symptom - Event exceptions (only happens in my app)_\nThese exceptions only happen in my (cant share) app, i cant repo them, but parts of this apply to all react apps. Please read thru - it will all make sense when you get to the end and if you examine my poc.\n\nDestroying the Iframe, leaves React and its event dispatching system in memory. I have a  mixture of x-tag, webcomponents which are used to \"create\" the iframe and load the react app. After the custom element is used (lets call it <EMBED-REACT>), the console starts showing exceptions all within react code. This is a side effect of the react dispatchEvent still being active and trying to do stuff.\n\n``` javascript\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeName' of null\nshouldUseChangeEvent @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:14296\nextractEvents @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:14536\nextractEvents @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:13000\nhandleTopLevel @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:19816\nhandleTopLevelImpl @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:23870\nperform @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:15510\nbatchedUpdates @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:23787\nbatchedUpdates @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:14673\ndispatchEvent @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:23946\n```\n\nI know about `ReactEventListener.dispatchEvent`(snip below) where i can disable react( i havent actually tried) to avoid the exceptions, but that would leave the memory leak.\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/client/ReactEventListener.js#158\n\n``` javascript\n dispatchEvent: function(topLevelType, nativeEvent) {\n    if (!ReactEventListener._enabled) {\n      return;\n    }\n```\n\nIts rather easy to prove that react remains in memory, simply goto the compiled app, find the `React dispatchEvent` and insert a console.log and watch as it continues to \"print\" stuff after unmounting the last component, even though there are no listeners. In my case the exception is caused because all `extractEvents` eventually default to \"window\" as the \"target\".\n\nThere are multiple copies of the same basic idea in various react functions, where it tries to get a target that it assumes will never be null. If one doesnt load react in an iframe, then window is always defined.\n\n``` javascript\nvar targetNode = targetInst ?\n      ReactDOMComponentTree.getNodeFromInstance(targetInst) : window;\n```\n\nLater the `shouldUseChangeEvent` tries to read the nodeName of the now \"undefined\" window, because its iframe has been destroyed, but that now results in an exception (null pointer etc).\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/045f1a791c6e17253e9d927ffca70ae5d00b4fe5/src/renderers/dom/client/eventPlugins/ChangeEventPlugin.js#L72 ...\n\n``` javascript\nfunction shouldUseChangeEvent(elem) {\n  var nodeName = elem.nodeName && elem.nodeName.toLowerCase();\n  return nodeName === 'select' || nodeName === 'input' && elem.type === 'file';\n}\n```\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nThere are probably two possible solutions, that work in tandem.\n\n1) Firstly React should provide an API that will remove all its global event listeners. Naturally it could complain if there are any active components that remain mounted. This API may be internal/private (not public), if #2 was implemented. It might be called something like `React.shutdownAll` Because everything is gone, the next React render would setup all its globals again.\n\n2) React should dispose of all its global event handlers when the last or \"root\" component is unmounted. This would call the _new api_ mentioned in 1. \n\nEither option solves my problem, where i wish to either let react shutdown gracefully. With this in mind i could.\n- unmount iframe powered react ui component.\n- call React.disposeGlobals (mentioned above). If unmounting auto calls an internal `React.shutdownAll` then this step is skipped.\n- destroy iframe.\n\n_Proof #2_\nGoto your compiled out, locate the `dispatchEvent` and add a console.log, notice even after the last / root container is unmounted stuff will continue to be printed because the event listeners are still active.\n\nI did a very quick scan of the abstraction around adding listeners, and i couldnt see the remove function being stored and then called to cleanup.\n\n_Proof #3_\nLook at my last section below where i have a proof of concept form of the popular todomvc react example.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nReact 15.0.2\nReact-Dom 15.0.2\nReact-redux 4.4.5 (might be useful to know)\n\n**Reproducable use case**\n\nSorry i tried but decided that using the facebook jsfiddle wasnt really a smart thing for the following reasons.\n- the compile the \"jsx\" content means loading babel etc to compile (babel, jsfiddle etc too many moving parts)\n- its \"hard\" to get the \"root component\" that is inserted into the \"output\" box and \n- its even just too \"hard\" to put the jsx compiled output into somewhere for the iframe src= to \"load\".\n\nI have forked the popular todomvc app and added a few minor edits to recreate, reload, render+unmount x100, destroy everything about the app, and try again in a loop separated by a sleep.\n- https://todomvc.com (todomvc main site)\n- https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc (todomvc github)\n- https://github.com/mP1/todomvc/pull/2 (my fork - with comments and snapshots of chrome dev tools timeline memory graph)\n\nHopefully we can trust the todomvc guys are doing the right thing, no dumb memory leaks. If you examine it should be obvious the only thing im adding is support for my horrible create app, run app, render+unmount many times, render, unmount, sleep a bit and then loop again until counter exhausted.\n\nSorry if this is boring but as a convenience i will list the basic instructions to \"run\" the react version of my branch on your local machines...\n1. clone https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc.git\n2. in the root, run \"gulp\", to compile everything.\n3. run something like \"python -m SimpleHTTPServer\"\n   4A. navigate to http://localhost:8000/examples/react/index.html \n   4B. navigate to http://localhost:8000/examples/react/index3.html\n   // /examples/react corresponds to the dist/examples/react directory that gulp built into.\n\nMy poc supports 3 concepts.\n- re-run todomvc over and over again in \"same\" window.\n- create iframe, load todomvc js in the iframe but render to outer window, unmount, destroy iframe, try 20x\n- create custom element, webcontainer creates iframe and load todomvc js in the iframe but render to outer window, unmount, destroy custom element, try 20x\n\nIf you look at my p/r against todomvc you will see many helpful pictures with memory leak graphs from chrome dev tools for each of the 3 described scenarios and some commentary.\n\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

By this I mean that components are aware of the hooks they consume and depend on them explicitly.\r\nThis [issue thread on the recompose repo](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/issues/756) discusses this issue in some detail and how recompose favored keeping components dumb, but wraps them in HOC's to make them smart. Hooks promote baking the smartness right into the component itself.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nReact should offer a way to decouple components from the hooks they consume. I suggest a `withHooks` HOC that maps hooks to props. This will be a familiar model for those who have used redux with react.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst withHooks = mapHooksToProps => WrappedComponent => {\r\n  return props => {\r\n    let hookProps = mapHooksToProps(props);\r\n    return <WrappedComponent {...hookProps} {...props} />;\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst Counter = props => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <div>Counter: {props.counter}</div>\r\n      <button onClick={props.increment}>Increment</button>\r\n      <button onClick={props.decrement}>Decrement</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst mapHooksToProps = props => {\r\n  let [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    counter,\r\n    increment: () => setCounter(prev => prev + 1),\r\n    decrement: () => setCounter(prev => prev - 1)\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst EnhancedCounter = withHooks(mapHooksToProps)(Counter);\r\n```\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/ympq0rlv79\r\n\r\nSome reasons why this is nice:\r\n\r\n1) It decouples components from the things that make them smart. Some examples of things that could make dumb components smart include hooks, redux, and good ol' parent components. By mapping hooks to props, we make it very easy to swap a dumb component's hook-powered 'brain' for a new 'brain', say a redux-powered 'brain'.\r\n\r\n2) Not sure if it's a good idea, but i know several people trying to replace redux with hooks in their applications. For these people, migrations from redux to hooks would be dead simple because they could replace `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` with `mapHooksToProps` and wouldn't have to worry about touching the underlying component.\r\n \r\n3) Testing is also easier because we can test the component in isolation without the hooks baked in.\r\n\r\n4) It makes prop overrides possible. In the case of our EnhancedCounter, we could override the counter prop by doing `<EnhancedCounter counter={10} />`. A real world example of hooks making things harder to override includes material-ui's [new styling approach via hooks](https://material-ui.com/css-in-js/basics/#hook-api). Because classes are provided via hook and no longer via props, we would need custom logic to override classes via props with the new hook-based approach:\r\n```jsx\r\nexport default function Hook(props) {\r\n  let classes = useStyles();\r\n  classes = {...classes, ...props.classes};\r\n  return <Button className={classes.root}>Hook</Button>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

I want to ask a question about a way to avoid reconciliation process.\r\n\r\nToday I can see the following process:\r\n\r\n1. Component wants to re-render.\r\n2. Component render method provides new virtual dom.\r\n3. Some react diff library tries to find some non-optimal way to morph old virtual dom into new one.\r\n\r\nPlease fix me if I am wrong, I am not familiar with react codebase.\r\n\r\nI can see an information in [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html):\r\n\r\n> you don\u2019t have to worry about exactly what changes on every update\r\n\r\nBut your solution has complexity about O(n) or even worse, so user should care about what changes sometimes. When user knows what changed he will be able to provide O(log n) or even O(1) solution.\r\n\r\nFor example I am working with huge data list and I am receiving information from websocket about how to morph my list: append/prepend, remove, swap items, etc. I don't want to render huge component list and run reconciliation process for each mutation. I can tell virtual dom how to morph efficiently.\r\n\r\n![append](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/941925/44114154-05201870-a013-11e8-9c7a-2e5ed890e372.jpg)\r\n\r\nIs there a way for user to provide morph method? I can imagine some api like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// render is not defined\r\n\r\nmorph(component) {\r\n  if (...) {\r\n    component.append(<Item />);\r\n  } else {\r\n    (<Item />).prependTo(component.find({ key: '5' }));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you have any plans to implement it?

Unless I am incorrect, this means that any system that would like to implement optimisations based on external context, such as the react-redux `connect` function (that uses `mapStateToProps` to implement an efficient `shouldComponentUpdate`) will still need to rely on a HOC/render-prop to automate this optimisation.\r\n\r\nThe reason I am bringing this up is because one of the main benefits stated in the documentation is to reduce framework level use of HOC that \"pollute\" the tree, of which the react-redux connect HOC is probably the most prevalent use case. \r\n\r\nAdditionally redux (and `useRedux`) are specifically brought up as an exemplary use case, although with the current system it will cause large optimisation issues (since with no optimised `shouldComponentUpdate`, every \"connected\" component will re-render on every state change).\r\n(Although this might fit into the documentation repo, this is a discussion / opinion and I do not feel it is a \"mistake\" that I should report, but rather a discussion on importance).\r\n\r\nAn example solution for this could be if there was a way to use contexts in `React.memo` (which unless I'm incorrect only have access to `props` and `prevProps`)\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

This relates to Hooks.\r\n\r\nIt could also be that this is all expected behaviour and one of the workarounds mentioned is required.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI have a hook that depends on the `useContext` hook. Using it as follows works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MyHookedComponent = () => {\r\n    const contextValue = useContext(DemoContext);\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n       //Do something with contextValue\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst MyContextProviderComponent = () => {\r\n\r\n   return (\r\n        <DemoContext.Provider value={someContextValue}>\r\n                <MyHookedComponent />\r\n         </DemoContext.Provider>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat if I want to use the `getContext` hook inline in the same component that declares the `DemoContext.Provider` ?\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MyContextProviderComponent = () => {\r\n       const contextValue = useContext(DemoContext); //Of course this fails due to the Context hierarchy.\r\n   return (\r\n        <DemoContext.Provider value={someContextValue}>\r\n                     //Do something with contextValue\r\n         </DemoContext.Provider>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI seem to be unable to get this working.\r\n\r\n**Please note**:\r\n- I have a very good reason for solving my issue with Context and not passing props.\r\n- The implementation I show above looks trivial and dumb but it is the simplest way to illustrate what the use case is. In my implementation the `Provider` sits in a complex component that does a lot of data management which I really want to happen at this level.\r\n- The usual way to use this will be the first working version I noted above, it is only in the case where the user would want to use the hook inline inside the `Provider`.\r\n- I have searched for a couple of hours and tried various configurations without success, so my apologies if this is a duplicate of another issue.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAny method to consume context inline in the provider using the same re-usable hook without having to revert back to render props.\r\n\r\nI know I can solve this with **render props** but I am trying to convert an implementation using render props to hooks. I also know I can hoist the Context Provider higher up but in my implementation it would quadruple the code complexity to develop and maintain while introducing extra complexity into the user interface.\r\n\r\nAlso, by extracting the body inside the `Provider` to a new component I can also solve this but ideally I would not like to have a user do this for this use case.\r\n\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For instance, maybe you need to pass an object to a library, and you'd like to avoid storing the individual object items as separate prop variables such that you don't need to redefine them together as a dict later on, but changes are due to a single element in the dict that you'd like visibility on in react devTools.\r\n\r\nIn rarer cases, it is unavoidable having props that aren't nested objects. For instance, how could I preserve the `.prototype` key of my `props` object without react stripping it? If I wrap my props inside an object, that key can be preserved. But now *all* my props are considered 1 prop to the profiler and I have no visibility on which prop changed.

So the interval still fires, overwriting `setLapse(0)` that happened during the event with its `setLapse(someValue)`.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of the issue described in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14750#issuecomment-460409609, or at least a part of it:\r\n\r\n>In fact, this problem exists even for regular React keystrokes (and other \u201cdiscrete\u201d events). The solution to that would be to flush passive effects before we get a discrete event.\r\n\r\nBut here, it seems like this wouldn\u2019t be sufficient because the effect flips *as a result* of the click, not before it. So should `setState` inside a discrete event *also* flush passive effect? Seems like not. (That would defeat the purpose of delaying them.)\r\n\r\nSo this is working as designed, and the fix is just `useLayoutEffect` when the timing matters?

Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI'm trying to build a system that auto-detects if data is used in a React component. To do this, I detect usage during `render()` by using Proxies, which can register all access. This data, in turn, is used to prevent needless re-renders.\r\n\r\nA parent component can pass a Proxy which represents a string, for example, to a child component, which, without knowing it is a Proxy, can use this value in a calculation (e.g. `props.value + 1` or `` `The value is ${props.value}` ``). This can be handled with `proxy[Symbol.toPrimitive]()`, which is called by JS automatically when used in this sort of expression.\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't work if the child now passes the proxy directly to React as a child:\r\n```jsx\r\n  return (<span>{this.props.childValue</span>);\r\n```\r\nReact will do a `typeof` on the child, find it is an object, and report `Objects are not valid as a React child`. Unfortunately, `typeof` cannot be spoofed with Proxy, and it will always return `'object'`.\r\n\r\nThe relevant code is found [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc/packages/react/src/ReactChildren.js#L189-L204). The alternative could be for React to check if there's a `child[Symbol.tpPrimitive]` and, if so, evaluate it to find the intended value, and to retry with this value as the child.\r\nIt could be as simple as inserting the following code [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc/packages/react/src/ReactChildren.js#L189):\r\n```js\r\n  if (typeof Symbol !== 'undefined') {\r\n    const toPrimitive = children[Symbol.toPrimitive];\r\n    if (toPrimitive) {\r\n      const value = toPrimitive('string');\r\n      if (typeof value !== 'object') {\r\n\t\treturn traverseAllChildrenImpl(\r\n\t\t  value,\r\n\t\t  nameSoFar,\r\n\t\t  callback,\r\n\t\t  traverseContext,\r\n\t\t)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great if React would support this use-case. The alternative is for parent components to resolve the value, which would attribute the access to the parent component, instead of the child, where it's really being used. This in turn would cause the parent to be rerendered when only the child is being changed.\r\n\r\nIf the child is aware it may be receiving Proxy objects, it can resolve the value itself. However, the whole point of using Proxies is to automate all the refresh logic (like `shouldComponentUpdate`). Also, not needing to resolve the value would allow the value to propagate through to descendant components which may be wholly unaware of the proxy. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

The idea being \"our\" react app has its javascript loaded in an iframe, but the \"main\" window hosts dom elements from the customers and our react app. That bit works fine. As time goes on \"our\" react UI is no longer needed, and then react root is removed, and the iframe destroyed. These apps are often long lived so there will be times when the react app needs to appear again, and the iframe is recreated and everything reloaded. This can and will happen many times.\n\n_Goal_\nWe would like to NOT keep the iframe around when its not actually needed, but rather re-create just in time when it is needed. This app is used by customers and they would like to embed our \"react\" app, without interference with their \"app\" and all its javascript, which is why we are doing the iframe thing.\n\n_Problem_\nIt is evident by watching the chrome dev tools \"timeline\" memory graph that memory always increases each time a new iframe is created and the react UI is init'd. Unmounting and destroying the iframe, never causes the memory to drop to \"near\" original before load value. Repeating this process multiple times slowly show an increase memory.\n\nThis also causes a more immediate problem, in that react is throwing exceptions on every event (click, type etc) because the window of the iframe is now null.\n\n_Proof: First symptom - Event exceptions (only happens in my app)_\nThese exceptions only happen in my (cant share) app, i cant repo them, but parts of this apply to all react apps. Please read thru - it will all make sense when you get to the end and if you examine my poc.\n\nDestroying the Iframe, leaves React and its event dispatching system in memory. I have a  mixture of x-tag, webcomponents which are used to \"create\" the iframe and load the react app. After the custom element is used (lets call it <EMBED-REACT>), the console starts showing exceptions all within react code. This is a side effect of the react dispatchEvent still being active and trying to do stuff.\n\n``` javascript\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeName' of null\nshouldUseChangeEvent @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:14296\nextractEvents @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:14536\nextractEvents @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:13000\nhandleTopLevel @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:19816\nhandleTopLevelImpl @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:23870\nperform @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:15510\nbatchedUpdates @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:23787\nbatchedUpdates @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:14673\ndispatchEvent @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:23946\n```\n\nI know about `ReactEventListener.dispatchEvent`(snip below) where i can disable react( i havent actually tried) to avoid the exceptions, but that would leave the memory leak.\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/client/ReactEventListener.js#158\n\n``` javascript\n dispatchEvent: function(topLevelType, nativeEvent) {\n    if (!ReactEventListener._enabled) {\n      return;\n    }\n```\n\nIts rather easy to prove that react remains in memory, simply goto the compiled app, find the `React dispatchEvent` and insert a console.log and watch as it continues to \"print\" stuff after unmounting the last component, even though there are no listeners. In my case the exception is caused because all `extractEvents` eventually default to \"window\" as the \"target\".\n\nThere are multiple copies of the same basic idea in various react functions, where it tries to get a target that it assumes will never be null. If one doesnt load react in an iframe, then window is always defined.\n\n``` javascript\nvar targetNode = targetInst ?\n      ReactDOMComponentTree.getNodeFromInstance(targetInst) : window;\n```\n\nLater the `shouldUseChangeEvent` tries to read the nodeName of the now \"undefined\" window, because its iframe has been destroyed, but that now results in an exception (null pointer etc).\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/045f1a791c6e17253e9d927ffca70ae5d00b4fe5/src/renderers/dom/client/eventPlugins/ChangeEventPlugin.js#L72 ...\n\n``` javascript\nfunction shouldUseChangeEvent(elem) {\n  var nodeName = elem.nodeName && elem.nodeName.toLowerCase();\n  return nodeName === 'select' || nodeName === 'input' && elem.type === 'file';\n}\n```\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nThere are probably two possible solutions, that work in tandem.\n\n1) Firstly React should provide an API that will remove all its global event listeners. Naturally it could complain if there are any active components that remain mounted. This API may be internal/private (not public), if #2 was implemented. It might be called something like `React.shutdownAll` Because everything is gone, the next React render would setup all its globals again.\n\n2) React should dispose of all its global event handlers when the last or \"root\" component is unmounted. This would call the _new api_ mentioned in 1. \n\nEither option solves my problem, where i wish to either let react shutdown gracefully. With this in mind i could.\n- unmount iframe powered react ui component.\n- call React.disposeGlobals (mentioned above). If unmounting auto calls an internal `React.shutdownAll` then this step is skipped.\n- destroy iframe.\n\n_Proof #2_\nGoto your compiled out, locate the `dispatchEvent` and add a console.log, notice even after the last / root container is unmounted stuff will continue to be printed because the event listeners are still active.\n\nI did a very quick scan of the abstraction around adding listeners, and i couldnt see the remove function being stored and then called to cleanup.\n\n_Proof #3_\nLook at my last section below where i have a proof of concept form of the popular todomvc react example.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nReact 15.0.2\nReact-Dom 15.0.2\nReact-redux 4.4.5 (might be useful to know)\n\n**Reproducable use case**\n\nSorry i tried but decided that using the facebook jsfiddle wasnt really a smart thing for the following reasons.\n- the compile the \"jsx\" content means loading babel etc to compile (babel, jsfiddle etc too many moving parts)\n- its \"hard\" to get the \"root component\" that is inserted into the \"output\" box and \n- its even just too \"hard\" to put the jsx compiled output into somewhere for the iframe src= to \"load\".\n\nI have forked the popular todomvc app and added a few minor edits to recreate, reload, render+unmount x100, destroy everything about the app, and try again in a loop separated by a sleep.\n- https://todomvc.com (todomvc main site)\n- https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc (todomvc github)\n- https://github.com/mP1/todomvc/pull/2 (my fork - with comments and snapshots of chrome dev tools timeline memory graph)\n\nHopefully we can trust the todomvc guys are doing the right thing, no dumb memory leaks. If you examine it should be obvious the only thing im adding is support for my horrible create app, run app, render+unmount many times, render, unmount, sleep a bit and then loop again until counter exhausted.\n\nSorry if this is boring but as a convenience i will list the basic instructions to \"run\" the react version of my branch on your local machines...\n1. clone https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc.git\n2. in the root, run \"gulp\", to compile everything.\n3. run something like \"python -m SimpleHTTPServer\"\n   4A. navigate to http://localhost:8000/examples/react/index.html \n   4B. navigate to http://localhost:8000/examples/react/index3.html\n   // /examples/react corresponds to the dist/examples/react directory that gulp built into.\n\nMy poc supports 3 concepts.\n- re-run todomvc over and over again in \"same\" window.\n- create iframe, load todomvc js in the iframe but render to outer window, unmount, destroy iframe, try 20x\n- create custom element, webcontainer creates iframe and load todomvc js in the iframe but render to outer window, unmount, destroy custom element, try 20x\n\nIf you look at my p/r against todomvc you will see many helpful pictures with memory leak graphs from chrome dev tools for each of the 3 described scenarios and some commentary.\n\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

By this I mean that components are aware of the hooks they consume and depend on them explicitly.\r\nThis [issue thread on the recompose repo](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/issues/756) discusses this issue in some detail and how recompose favored keeping components dumb, but wraps them in HOC's to make them smart. Hooks promote baking the smartness right into the component itself.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nReact should offer a way to decouple components from the hooks they consume. I suggest a `withHooks` HOC that maps hooks to props. This will be a familiar model for those who have used redux with react.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst withHooks = mapHooksToProps => WrappedComponent => {\r\n  return props => {\r\n    let hookProps = mapHooksToProps(props);\r\n    return <WrappedComponent {...hookProps} {...props} />;\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst Counter = props => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <div>Counter: {props.counter}</div>\r\n      <button onClick={props.increment}>Increment</button>\r\n      <button onClick={props.decrement}>Decrement</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst mapHooksToProps = props => {\r\n  let [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    counter,\r\n    increment: () => setCounter(prev => prev + 1),\r\n    decrement: () => setCounter(prev => prev - 1)\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst EnhancedCounter = withHooks(mapHooksToProps)(Counter);\r\n```\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/ympq0rlv79\r\n\r\nSome reasons why this is nice:\r\n\r\n1) It decouples components from the things that make them smart. Some examples of things that could make dumb components smart include hooks, redux, and good ol' parent components. By mapping hooks to props, we make it very easy to swap a dumb component's hook-powered 'brain' for a new 'brain', say a redux-powered 'brain'.\r\n\r\n2) Not sure if it's a good idea, but i know several people trying to replace redux with hooks in their applications. For these people, migrations from redux to hooks would be dead simple because they could replace `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` with `mapHooksToProps` and wouldn't have to worry about touching the underlying component.\r\n \r\n3) Testing is also easier because we can test the component in isolation without the hooks baked in.\r\n\r\n4) It makes prop overrides possible. In the case of our EnhancedCounter, we could override the counter prop by doing `<EnhancedCounter counter={10} />`. A real world example of hooks making things harder to override includes material-ui's [new styling approach via hooks](https://material-ui.com/css-in-js/basics/#hook-api). Because classes are provided via hook and no longer via props, we would need custom logic to override classes via props with the new hook-based approach:\r\n```jsx\r\nexport default function Hook(props) {\r\n  let classes = useStyles();\r\n  classes = {...classes, ...props.classes};\r\n  return <Button className={classes.root}>Hook</Button>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

I want to ask a question about a way to avoid reconciliation process.\r\n\r\nToday I can see the following process:\r\n\r\n1. Component wants to re-render.\r\n2. Component render method provides new virtual dom.\r\n3. Some react diff library tries to find some non-optimal way to morph old virtual dom into new one.\r\n\r\nPlease fix me if I am wrong, I am not familiar with react codebase.\r\n\r\nI can see an information in [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html):\r\n\r\n> you don\u2019t have to worry about exactly what changes on every update\r\n\r\nBut your solution has complexity about O(n) or even worse, so user should care about what changes sometimes. When user knows what changed he will be able to provide O(log n) or even O(1) solution.\r\n\r\nFor example I am working with huge data list and I am receiving information from websocket about how to morph my list: append/prepend, remove, swap items, etc. I don't want to render huge component list and run reconciliation process for each mutation. I can tell virtual dom how to morph efficiently.\r\n\r\n![append](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/941925/44114154-05201870-a013-11e8-9c7a-2e5ed890e372.jpg)\r\n\r\nIs there a way for user to provide morph method? I can imagine some api like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// render is not defined\r\n\r\nmorph(component) {\r\n  if (...) {\r\n    component.append(<Item />);\r\n  } else {\r\n    (<Item />).prependTo(component.find({ key: '5' }));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you have any plans to implement it?

Unless I am incorrect, this means that any system that would like to implement optimisations based on external context, such as the react-redux `connect` function (that uses `mapStateToProps` to implement an efficient `shouldComponentUpdate`) will still need to rely on a HOC/render-prop to automate this optimisation.\r\n\r\nThe reason I am bringing this up is because one of the main benefits stated in the documentation is to reduce framework level use of HOC that \"pollute\" the tree, of which the react-redux connect HOC is probably the most prevalent use case. \r\n\r\nAdditionally redux (and `useRedux`) are specifically brought up as an exemplary use case, although with the current system it will cause large optimisation issues (since with no optimised `shouldComponentUpdate`, every \"connected\" component will re-render on every state change).\r\n(Although this might fit into the documentation repo, this is a discussion / opinion and I do not feel it is a \"mistake\" that I should report, but rather a discussion on importance).\r\n\r\nAn example solution for this could be if there was a way to use contexts in `React.memo` (which unless I'm incorrect only have access to `props` and `prevProps`)\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

This relates to Hooks.\r\n\r\nIt could also be that this is all expected behaviour and one of the workarounds mentioned is required.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI have a hook that depends on the `useContext` hook. Using it as follows works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MyHookedComponent = () => {\r\n    const contextValue = useContext(DemoContext);\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n       //Do something with contextValue\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst MyContextProviderComponent = () => {\r\n\r\n   return (\r\n        <DemoContext.Provider value={someContextValue}>\r\n                <MyHookedComponent />\r\n         </DemoContext.Provider>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat if I want to use the `getContext` hook inline in the same component that declares the `DemoContext.Provider` ?\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MyContextProviderComponent = () => {\r\n       const contextValue = useContext(DemoContext); //Of course this fails due to the Context hierarchy.\r\n   return (\r\n        <DemoContext.Provider value={someContextValue}>\r\n                     //Do something with contextValue\r\n         </DemoContext.Provider>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI seem to be unable to get this working.\r\n\r\n**Please note**:\r\n- I have a very good reason for solving my issue with Context and not passing props.\r\n- The implementation I show above looks trivial and dumb but it is the simplest way to illustrate what the use case is. In my implementation the `Provider` sits in a complex component that does a lot of data management which I really want to happen at this level.\r\n- The usual way to use this will be the first working version I noted above, it is only in the case where the user would want to use the hook inline inside the `Provider`.\r\n- I have searched for a couple of hours and tried various configurations without success, so my apologies if this is a duplicate of another issue.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAny method to consume context inline in the provider using the same re-usable hook without having to revert back to render props.\r\n\r\nI know I can solve this with **render props** but I am trying to convert an implementation using render props to hooks. I also know I can hoist the Context Provider higher up but in my implementation it would quadruple the code complexity to develop and maintain while introducing extra complexity into the user interface.\r\n\r\nAlso, by extracting the body inside the `Provider` to a new component I can also solve this but ideally I would not like to have a user do this for this use case.\r\n\"\n\nIs this issue reporting a bug?

For instance, maybe you need to pass an object to a library, and you'd like to avoid storing the individual object items as separate prop variables such that you don't need to redefine them together as a dict later on, but changes are due to a single element in the dict that you'd like visibility on in react devTools.\r\n\r\nIn rarer cases, it is unavoidable having props that aren't nested objects. For instance, how could I preserve the `.prototype` key of my `props` object without react stripping it? If I wrap my props inside an object, that key can be preserved. But now *all* my props are considered 1 prop to the profiler and I have no visibility on which prop changed.

So the interval still fires, overwriting `setLapse(0)` that happened during the event with its `setLapse(someValue)`.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of the issue described in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14750#issuecomment-460409609, or at least a part of it:\r\n\r\n>In fact, this problem exists even for regular React keystrokes (and other \u201cdiscrete\u201d events). The solution to that would be to flush passive effects before we get a discrete event.\r\n\r\nBut here, it seems like this wouldn\u2019t be sufficient because the effect flips *as a result* of the click, not before it. So should `setState` inside a discrete event *also* flush passive effect? Seems like not. (That would defeat the purpose of delaying them.)\r\n\r\nSo this is working as designed, and the fix is just `useLayoutEffect` when the timing matters?

Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI'm trying to build a system that auto-detects if data is used in a React component. To do this, I detect usage during `render()` by using Proxies, which can register all access. This data, in turn, is used to prevent needless re-renders.\r\n\r\nA parent component can pass a Proxy which represents a string, for example, to a child component, which, without knowing it is a Proxy, can use this value in a calculation (e.g. `props.value + 1` or `` `The value is ${props.value}` ``). This can be handled with `proxy[Symbol.toPrimitive]()`, which is called by JS automatically when used in this sort of expression.\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't work if the child now passes the proxy directly to React as a child:\r\n```jsx\r\n  return (<span>{this.props.childValue</span>);\r\n```\r\nReact will do a `typeof` on the child, find it is an object, and report `Objects are not valid as a React child`. Unfortunately, `typeof` cannot be spoofed with Proxy, and it will always return `'object'`.\r\n\r\nThe relevant code is found [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc/packages/react/src/ReactChildren.js#L189-L204). The alternative could be for React to check if there's a `child[Symbol.tpPrimitive]` and, if so, evaluate it to find the intended value, and to retry with this value as the child.\r\nIt could be as simple as inserting the following code [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc/packages/react/src/ReactChildren.js#L189):\r\n```js\r\n  if (typeof Symbol !== 'undefined') {\r\n    const toPrimitive = children[Symbol.toPrimitive];\r\n    if (toPrimitive) {\r\n      const value = toPrimitive('string');\r\n      if (typeof value !== 'object') {\r\n\t\treturn traverseAllChildrenImpl(\r\n\t\t  value,\r\n\t\t  nameSoFar,\r\n\t\t  callback,\r\n\t\t  traverseContext,\r\n\t\t)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great if React would support this use-case. The alternative is for parent components to resolve the value, which would attribute the access to the parent component, instead of the child, where it's really being used. This in turn would cause the parent to be rerendered when only the child is being changed.\r\n\r\nIf the child is aware it may be receiving Proxy objects, it can resolve the value itself. However, the whole point of using Proxies is to automate all the refresh logic (like `shouldComponentUpdate`). Also, not needing to resolve the value would allow the value to propagate through to descendant components which may be wholly unaware of the proxy. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
