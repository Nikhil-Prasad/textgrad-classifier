Specifying criteria such as keywords or phrases associated with resolution and contentment will provide the model with a stronger framework to make accurate classifications. For example, conditions like \"issue resolved completely\", \"happy with the service\", or \"no further questions\" could be spelled out in the prompt.\n\n2. **Contextual Clues**: Introduce examples or scenarios describing both satisfactory and unsatisfactory notes. This method will help the system recognize implicit hints or nuances. A lack of explicit indicators in the note should not automatically default to \"needs_follow_up\".\n\n3. **Exploration of Implicit Satisfaction**: Consider that satisfaction may not always be explicitly stated. Emphasize that satisfaction can be inferred from a lack of negative feedback or additional questions from the customer. Encourage the system to read between the lines and understand this subtext within the confines of the prompt.\n\n4. **Conciseness vs. Clarification**: While the prompt asks for succinct output, emphasize that detailed analysis precedes the concise response. A brief on the kind of thinking and checking the model should do before concluding can help.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Negative Indicators**: Highlight what constitutes a \"needs_follow_up\" situation to make the distinction clearer. This could involve identifying any expressions of dissatisfaction, confusion, or the customer's explicit request for further help.\n\nBy incorporating these additional details and strategies, the system prompt can better guide the language model in accurately classifying the support encounter, improving its performance in aligning with the correct answers.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nRoad government look investment last throw.

Here's how you can adjust the prompt:\n\n1. **Provide Clear Criteria**: Define what constitutes a satisfactory or unsatisfactory support note. For instance, mention that a satisfactory outcome might include phrases that indicate resolution, contentment, or lack of further assistance needed.\n\n2. **Emphasize Indicators of Satisfaction**: Highlight examples of language that can indicate satisfaction, even if they are subtle or implied.\n\nRevised Prompt:\nYou are an AI assistant that analyzes customer support notes to determine if the support provided was satisfactory. A note is \"satisfactory\" if it implies resolution, contentment, or no further assistance is needed, even if not explicitly stated. Classify the notes as \"satisfactory\" or \"needs_follow_up\" based solely on these criteria. Be concise and answer with only the classification label. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To enhance the system's ability to correctly classify customer support notes as \"satisfactory,\" the system prompt should be improved by integrating several aspects:\n\n1. **Defined Criteria for Classification**: The current prompt is too broad and lacks specific indicators that the model should look for to identify satisfaction. Specifying criteria such as keywords or phrases associated with resolution and contentment will provide the model with a stronger framework to make accurate classifications. For example, conditions like \"issue resolved completely\", \"happy with the service\", or \"no further questions\" could be spelled out in the prompt.\n\n2. **Contextual Clues**: Introduce examples or scenarios describing both satisfactory and unsatisfactory notes. This method will help the system recognize implicit hints or nuances. A lack of explicit indicators in the note should not automatically default to \"needs_follow_up\".\n\n3. **Exploration of Implicit Satisfaction**: Consider that satisfaction may not always be explicitly stated. Emphasize that satisfaction can be inferred from a lack of negative feedback or additional questions from the customer. Encourage the system to read between the lines and understand this subtext within the confines of the prompt.\n\n4. **Conciseness vs. Clarification**: While the prompt asks for succinct output, emphasize that detailed analysis precedes the concise response. A brief on the kind of thinking and checking the model should do before concluding can help.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Negative Indicators**: Highlight what constitutes a \"needs_follow_up\" situation to make the distinction clearer. This could involve identifying any expressions of dissatisfaction, confusion, or the customer's explicit request for further help.\n\nBy incorporating these additional details and strategies, the system prompt can better guide the language model in accurately classifying the support encounter, improving its performance in aligning with the correct answers.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nRoad government look investment last throw.

This helps the system learn to detect subtle cues.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis:** Encourage the system to understand the broader context or narrative of the note that might suggest a satisfied customer \u2014 such as lack of frustration or tension in the language used.\n\n5. **Keyword Expansion:** Include indirect indicators like neutral to positive descriptions of outcomes or experiences as potential signs of satisfaction.\n\nBy integrating these elements into the prompt and learning dataset, the system can improve its accuracy in detecting subtle indicators of satisfaction. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>1. **Expand on Implicit Recognition:** The current prompt may overly rely on explicit satisfaction phrases. You should guide the system to better identify implicit signals of satisfaction, such as the absence of negative language, contextual resolution, or a calm and constructive tone. This helps in capturing the nuances of language that imply satisfaction even when explicit phrases are absent.\n\n2. **Incorporate More Contextual Clues:** Highlight the necessity to analyze the context surrounding the customer's language. The system should be aware of how the story or sequence of customer support interactions unfolds, noting any shifts in tone or resolution progress.\n\n3. **Include More Diverse Examples:** Provide varied and complex examples of customer notes that could be classified as 'satisfactory' despite lacking clear satisfaction indicators. This can train the system on a broader range of subtleties in language that imply satisfaction.\n\n4. **Clarify What Constitutes Dissatisfaction:** Clearly define what exact elements or phrases should signal the classification of 'needs_follow_up.' Lower emphasis on explicit dissatisfaction can potentially reduce the number of false positives in the 'needs_follow_up' category.\n\n5. **Focus on Absence of Specific Phrases:** Emphasize detection of satisfaction through the absence of specific negative phrases or requests, which could more accurately guide the model in cases where satisfaction is implied rather than stated.\n\n6. **Reframe Interpretation of Neutral Tone:** Encourage the interpretation of a neutral customer tone, in absence of direct resolution indications, as possibly leaning towards satisfaction if no negative feedback or confusion is expressed.\n\n7. **Adapt Tone Sensitivity:** Train the system to be sensitive to varying tones of voice, where satisfaction might be subtle but identifiable based on positive or reassuring expressions beyond specific satisfaction keywords.\n\nBy refining these elements within the system prompt, the language model's ability to classify based on nuanced and implicit customer feedback will likely be improved, hence achieving a better alignment with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (system prompt for classification) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

Make the identification of implicit satisfaction a central aspect by stressing that many notes may not directly state satisfaction yet can still signify it through a lack of explicit complaints or issues.\n\n2. **Differentiation Between Neutral and Negative**: Clearly distinguish between neutrality and negativity. The prompt could better differentiate neutral comments, which should lean towards \"satisfactory,\" from vague dissatisfaction cues, which should lean towards \"needs_follow_up.\"\n\n3. **Revising Example Integration**: While it suggests considering varied examples, the prompt should integrate specific illustrative examples within the criteria to improve the model\u2019s training input. Including false positives (neutral-example mistakenly classified as needing follow-up) and false negatives (satisfactory-example not recognized) can guide more precise classification.\n\n4. **Amplifying Subtle Cue Sensitivity**: Further enhance focus on detecting and interpreting subtle cues in language, such as minor shades of tone and context that suggest resolution, even without typical resolution markers. This could involve more detailed instructions on evaluating linguistic elements such as word choice and sentence structure.\n\n5. **Avoidance of Over-Simplification**: The directive to be concise might cause the model to oversimplify the complexity of the input notes. Encourage a thoughtful weighing of all cues before concluding, rather than jumping to conclusions based solely on explicit absence or presence of certain words or phrases.\n\nBy integrating these refinements, the prompt could better guide the classification system in identifying the nuanced markers of satisfaction, resulting in improved accuracy in distinguishing between \"satisfactory\" and \"needs_follow_up\" classifications.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nFree southern life.

Specifying criteria such as keywords or phrases associated with resolution and contentment will provide the model with a stronger framework to make accurate classifications. For example, conditions like \"issue resolved completely\", \"happy with the service\", or \"no further questions\" could be spelled out in the prompt.\n\n2. **Contextual Clues**: Introduce examples or scenarios describing both satisfactory and unsatisfactory notes. This method will help the system recognize implicit hints or nuances. A lack of explicit indicators in the note should not automatically default to \"needs_follow_up\".\n\n3. **Exploration of Implicit Satisfaction**: Consider that satisfaction may not always be explicitly stated. Emphasize that satisfaction can be inferred from a lack of negative feedback or additional questions from the customer. Encourage the system to read between the lines and understand this subtext within the confines of the prompt.\n\n4. **Conciseness vs. Clarification**: While the prompt asks for succinct output, emphasize that detailed analysis precedes the concise response. A brief on the kind of thinking and checking the model should do before concluding can help.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Negative Indicators**: Highlight what constitutes a \"needs_follow_up\" situation to make the distinction clearer. This could involve identifying any expressions of dissatisfaction, confusion, or the customer's explicit request for further help.\n\nBy incorporating these additional details and strategies, the system prompt can better guide the language model in accurately classifying the support encounter, improving its performance in aligning with the correct answers.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nRoad government look investment last throw.

This helps the system learn to detect subtle cues.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis:** Encourage the system to understand the broader context or narrative of the note that might suggest a satisfied customer \u2014 such as lack of frustration or tension in the language used.\n\n5. **Keyword Expansion:** Include indirect indicators like neutral to positive descriptions of outcomes or experiences as potential signs of satisfaction.\n\nBy integrating these elements into the prompt and learning dataset, the system can improve its accuracy in detecting subtle indicators of satisfaction. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>1. **Expand on Implicit Recognition:** The current prompt may overly rely on explicit satisfaction phrases. You should guide the system to better identify implicit signals of satisfaction, such as the absence of negative language, contextual resolution, or a calm and constructive tone. This helps in capturing the nuances of language that imply satisfaction even when explicit phrases are absent.\n\n2. **Incorporate More Contextual Clues:** Highlight the necessity to analyze the context surrounding the customer's language. The system should be aware of how the story or sequence of customer support interactions unfolds, noting any shifts in tone or resolution progress.\n\n3. **Include More Diverse Examples:** Provide varied and complex examples of customer notes that could be classified as 'satisfactory' despite lacking clear satisfaction indicators. This can train the system on a broader range of subtleties in language that imply satisfaction.\n\n4. **Clarify What Constitutes Dissatisfaction:** Clearly define what exact elements or phrases should signal the classification of 'needs_follow_up.' Lower emphasis on explicit dissatisfaction can potentially reduce the number of false positives in the 'needs_follow_up' category.\n\n5. **Focus on Absence of Specific Phrases:** Emphasize detection of satisfaction through the absence of specific negative phrases or requests, which could more accurately guide the model in cases where satisfaction is implied rather than stated.\n\n6. **Reframe Interpretation of Neutral Tone:** Encourage the interpretation of a neutral customer tone, in absence of direct resolution indications, as possibly leaning towards satisfaction if no negative feedback or confusion is expressed.\n\n7. **Adapt Tone Sensitivity:** Train the system to be sensitive to varying tones of voice, where satisfaction might be subtle but identifiable based on positive or reassuring expressions beyond specific satisfaction keywords.\n\nBy refining these elements within the system prompt, the language model's ability to classify based on nuanced and implicit customer feedback will likely be improved, hence achieving a better alignment with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (system prompt for classification) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

Guidance on identifying neutrality could help prevent the misclassification of neutral notes as requiring follow-up.\n\n2. **Strengthen the Role of Absence of Negative Feedback**: While the prompt recognizes the importance of implicit signals of satisfaction, it must stress the significance of the absence of negative feedback as a strong signal of satisfaction. This focus will help avoid unjustified escalations based on a lack of explicit positive language.\n\n3. **Clarify the Contextual Interpretation**: Context in customer support notes is often nuanced; thus, the prompt should include a more precise guideline for assessing context, potentially by providing questions or criteria to evaluate narrative flow and subtleties effectively.\n\n4. **Encourage Reliance on Overall Flow Rather Than Details**: Emphasize evaluating the overall narrative flow rather than focusing heavily on specific language cues. This may prevent a narrow interpretation of the text and promote understanding of subtle resolutions or satisfaction signals.\n\n5. **Include More Diverse and Clear Examples**: The prompt should integrate more varied examples of how implicit or neutral indicators imply satisfaction.

The absence of specific negative phrases or confusion should heavily indicate satisfaction, reinforcing that subtle signals, such as a steady, constructive tone, often imply contentment.\n\n3. **Contextual and Subtle Cue Analysis**: Pay close attention to the context, analyzing how the narrative unfolds and noting any absence of concern or negativity as a cue for satisfaction. Look for subtle narrative shifts, positive or unwavering tones, and the overall flow of the support process to gauge satisfaction.\n\n4. **Clarification of Needs Follow-Up**: Classify a note as \"needs_follow_up\" if there's explicit dissatisfaction, expressions of confusion, or specific requests for further assistance. Clearly define what elements signal the need for follow-up to avoid misclassification.\n\n5. **Incorporate Diverse Examples**: Include varied examples illustrating how implicit or neutral indicators imply satisfaction. Provide scenarios where satisfaction is inferred through context, even without direct statements of satisfaction.\n\nFocus on these guidelines to discern satisfaction through both explicit and implicit means. Be concise and answer with only the classification label. </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> To improve the system's prompt so it correctly classifies the input as \"satisfactory,\" consider implementing the following adjustments:\n\n1. **Highlight Neutral Indicator Emphasis**: Modify the prompt to emphasize that the absence of negative feedback or queries, even without explicitly positive statements, should heavily suggest satisfaction. Stress prioritizing neutral tone as an implicit sign of resolution.\n\n2. **Example Relevance and Breadth**: Incorporate specific examples illustrating how neutrality and lack of dissatisfaction indicate satisfaction. Diverse scenarios will clarify how to interpret notes lacking explicit positive cues but devoid of negative elements.\n\n3. **Subtle Cue Emphasis**: Strengthen the focus on slight narrative cues, such as a balanced or steady tone, and lack of escalation, as signals of contentment. Encourage a deep analysis of contextual cues that steer towards no follow-up.\n\n4. **Refine Confusion and Dissatisfaction Indications**: Clarify the significant difference between neutral, dissatisfaction, and confusion. Delineate more clearly what constitutes dissatisfaction or confusion to avoid misclassification due to overly cautious interpretation.\n\nIncorporate these changes to help the system better recognize when absence of negativity and tone are enough to classify a response as \"satisfactory.\" </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>To improve the system prompt for classification in alignment with the objective function:\n\n1. **Clarify Neutral Tone Significance**: The prompt should make it explicit that a neutral tone is not just acceptable but often a strong indicator of satisfaction. This could prevent the system from being overly cautious and defaulting to \"needs_follow_up\" when there is no explicit positive feedback, but also no negative cues.\n\n2. **Include Comprehensive Examples**: Enhance the section on diverse examples by introducing scenarios that capture the essence of implicit satisfaction through neutral cues. This will give the model contextual understanding that stretches beyond surface-level keywords or phrases.\n\n3. **Define 'Implicit Satisfaction' with Precision**: Sharpen the definition of implicit satisfaction by specifically outlining typical scenarios or common linguistic patterns that characterize this type of satisfaction. This helps systematize recognition of subtler cues beyond specific phrases.\n\n4. **Emphasize Absence of Red Flags**: Reiterate that the absence of dissatisfaction or requests for assistance is a positive indication. This could involve listing specific scenarios where nothing negative appeared, suggesting a condition implicitly resolved and thus leading to a \"satisfactory\" classification.\n\n5. **Distinguish Between Lack of Positivity vs. Negativity**: The prompt should elucidate the difference between lacking explicit positive affirmation and the presence of negativity. This will guide the model in recognizing that absence doesn't equate to negativity but possibly neutrality, which often leans towards satisfaction.\n\nIncorporating these strategic improvements could refine the system's classification accuracy by focusing on tonal subtleties and enhanced contextual interpretation, aiming for an optimized balance between recognizing implicit and explicit satisfaction cues.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nQuickly several leave race now until.

Make the identification of implicit satisfaction a central aspect by stressing that many notes may not directly state satisfaction yet can still signify it through a lack of explicit complaints or issues.\n\n2. **Differentiation Between Neutral and Negative**: Clearly distinguish between neutrality and negativity. The prompt could better differentiate neutral comments, which should lean towards \"satisfactory,\" from vague dissatisfaction cues, which should lean towards \"needs_follow_up.\"\n\n3. **Revising Example Integration**: While it suggests considering varied examples, the prompt should integrate specific illustrative examples within the criteria to improve the model\u2019s training input. Including false positives (neutral-example mistakenly classified as needing follow-up) and false negatives (satisfactory-example not recognized) can guide more precise classification.\n\n4. **Amplifying Subtle Cue Sensitivity**: Further enhance focus on detecting and interpreting subtle cues in language, such as minor shades of tone and context that suggest resolution, even without typical resolution markers. This could involve more detailed instructions on evaluating linguistic elements such as word choice and sentence structure.\n\n5. **Avoidance of Over-Simplification**: The directive to be concise might cause the model to oversimplify the complexity of the input notes. Encourage a thoughtful weighing of all cues before concluding, rather than jumping to conclusions based solely on explicit absence or presence of certain words or phrases.\n\nBy integrating these refinements, the prompt could better guide the classification system in identifying the nuanced markers of satisfaction, resulting in improved accuracy in distinguishing between \"satisfactory\" and \"needs_follow_up\" classifications.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nFree southern life.

Specifying criteria such as keywords or phrases associated with resolution and contentment will provide the model with a stronger framework to make accurate classifications. For example, conditions like \"issue resolved completely\", \"happy with the service\", or \"no further questions\" could be spelled out in the prompt.\n\n2. **Contextual Clues**: Introduce examples or scenarios describing both satisfactory and unsatisfactory notes. This method will help the system recognize implicit hints or nuances. A lack of explicit indicators in the note should not automatically default to \"needs_follow_up\".\n\n3. **Exploration of Implicit Satisfaction**: Consider that satisfaction may not always be explicitly stated. Emphasize that satisfaction can be inferred from a lack of negative feedback or additional questions from the customer. Encourage the system to read between the lines and understand this subtext within the confines of the prompt.\n\n4. **Conciseness vs. Clarification**: While the prompt asks for succinct output, emphasize that detailed analysis precedes the concise response. A brief on the kind of thinking and checking the model should do before concluding can help.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Negative Indicators**: Highlight what constitutes a \"needs_follow_up\" situation to make the distinction clearer. This could involve identifying any expressions of dissatisfaction, confusion, or the customer's explicit request for further help.\n\nBy incorporating these additional details and strategies, the system prompt can better guide the language model in accurately classifying the support encounter, improving its performance in aligning with the correct answers.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nRoad government look investment last throw.

You should guide the system to better identify implicit signals of satisfaction, such as the absence of negative language, contextual resolution, or a calm and constructive tone. This helps in capturing the nuances of language that imply satisfaction even when explicit phrases are absent.\n\n2. **Incorporate More Contextual Clues:** Highlight the necessity to analyze the context surrounding the customer's language. The system should be aware of how the story or sequence of customer support interactions unfolds, noting any shifts in tone or resolution progress.\n\n3. **Include More Diverse Examples:** Provide varied and complex examples of customer notes that could be classified as 'satisfactory' despite lacking clear satisfaction indicators. This can train the system on a broader range of subtleties in language that imply satisfaction.\n\n4. **Clarify What Constitutes Dissatisfaction:** Clearly define what exact elements or phrases should signal the classification of 'needs_follow_up.' Lower emphasis on explicit dissatisfaction can potentially reduce the number of false positives in the 'needs_follow_up' category.\n\n5. **Focus on Absence of Specific Phrases:** Emphasize detection of satisfaction through the absence of specific negative phrases or requests, which could more accurately guide the model in cases where satisfaction is implied rather than stated.\n\n6. **Reframe Interpretation of Neutral Tone:** Encourage the interpretation of a neutral customer tone, in absence of direct resolution indications, as possibly leaning towards satisfaction if no negative feedback or confusion is expressed.\n\n7. **Adapt Tone Sensitivity:** Train the system to be sensitive to varying tones of voice, where satisfaction might be subtle but identifiable based on positive or reassuring expressions beyond specific satisfaction keywords.\n\nBy refining these elements within the system prompt, the language model's ability to classify based on nuanced and implicit customer feedback will likely be improved, hence achieving a better alignment with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (system prompt for classification) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.", "message": "TextualGradientDescent prompt for update"}

The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>1. **Overemphasize on Implicit Satisfaction**: The current prompt leans towards recognizing implicit satisfaction but might still be inadequate in highlighting its subtle nature. Make the identification of implicit satisfaction a central aspect by stressing that many notes may not directly state satisfaction yet can still signify it through a lack of explicit complaints or issues.\n\n2. **Differentiation Between Neutral and Negative**: Clearly distinguish between neutrality and negativity. The prompt could better differentiate neutral comments, which should lean towards \"satisfactory,\" from vague dissatisfaction cues, which should lean towards \"needs_follow_up.\"\n\n3. **Revising Example Integration**: While it suggests considering varied examples, the prompt should integrate specific illustrative examples within the criteria to improve the model\u2019s training input. Including false positives (neutral-example mistakenly classified as needing follow-up) and false negatives (satisfactory-example not recognized) can guide more precise classification.\n\n4. **Amplifying Subtle Cue Sensitivity**: Further enhance focus on detecting and interpreting subtle cues in language, such as minor shades of tone and context that suggest resolution, even without typical resolution markers. This could involve more detailed instructions on evaluating linguistic elements such as word choice and sentence structure.\n\n5. **Avoidance of Over-Simplification**: The directive to be concise might cause the model to oversimplify the complexity of the input notes. Encourage a thoughtful weighing of all cues before concluding, rather than jumping to conclusions based solely on explicit absence or presence of certain words or phrases.\n\nBy integrating these refinements, the prompt could better guide the classification system in identifying the nuanced markers of satisfaction, resulting in improved accuracy in distinguishing between \"satisfactory\" and \"needs_follow_up\" classifications.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nFree southern life.

A lack of explicit indicators in the note should not automatically default to \"needs_follow_up\".\n\n3. **Exploration of Implicit Satisfaction**: Consider that satisfaction may not always be explicitly stated. Emphasize that satisfaction can be inferred from a lack of negative feedback or additional questions from the customer. Encourage the system to read between the lines and understand this subtext within the confines of the prompt.\n\n4. **Conciseness vs. Clarification**: While the prompt asks for succinct output, emphasize that detailed analysis precedes the concise response. A brief on the kind of thinking and checking the model should do before concluding can help.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Negative Indicators**: Highlight what constitutes a \"needs_follow_up\" situation to make the distinction clearer. This could involve identifying any expressions of dissatisfaction, confusion, or the customer's explicit request for further help.\n\nBy incorporating these additional details and strategies, the system prompt can better guide the language model in accurately classifying the support encounter, improving its performance in aligning with the correct answers.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nRoad government look investment last throw.

This helps the system learn to detect subtle cues.\n\n4. **Contextual Analysis:** Encourage the system to understand the broader context or narrative of the note that might suggest a satisfied customer \u2014 such as lack of frustration or tension in the language used.\n\n5. **Keyword Expansion:** Include indirect indicators like neutral to positive descriptions of outcomes or experiences as potential signs of satisfaction.\n\nBy integrating these elements into the prompt and learning dataset, the system can improve its accuracy in detecting subtle indicators of satisfaction. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as response from the language model\n\nHere is the feedback we got for system prompt for classification in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>1. **Expand on Implicit Recognition:** The current prompt may overly rely on explicit satisfaction phrases. You should guide the system to better identify implicit signals of satisfaction, such as the absence of negative language, contextual resolution, or a calm and constructive tone. This helps in capturing the nuances of language that imply satisfaction even when explicit phrases are absent.\n\n2. **Incorporate More Contextual Clues:** Highlight the necessity to analyze the context surrounding the customer's language. The system should be aware of how the story or sequence of customer support interactions unfolds, noting any shifts in tone or resolution progress.\n\n3. **Include More Diverse Examples:** Provide varied and complex examples of customer notes that could be classified as 'satisfactory' despite lacking clear satisfaction indicators. This can train the system on a broader range of subtleties in language that imply satisfaction.\n\n4. **Clarify What Constitutes Dissatisfaction:** Clearly define what exact elements or phrases should signal the classification of 'needs_follow_up.' Lower emphasis on explicit dissatisfaction can potentially reduce the number of false positives in the 'needs_follow_up' category.\n\n5. **Focus on Absence of Specific Phrases:** Emphasize detection of satisfaction through the absence of specific negative phrases or requests, which could more accurately guide the model in cases where satisfaction is implied rather than stated.\n\n6. **Reframe Interpretation of Neutral Tone:** Encourage the interpretation of a neutral customer tone, in absence of direct resolution indications, as possibly leaning towards satisfaction if no negative feedback or confusion is expressed.\n\n7. **Adapt Tone Sensitivity:** Train the system to be sensitive to varying tones of voice, where satisfaction might be subtle but identifiable based on positive or reassuring expressions beyond specific satisfaction keywords.\n\nBy refining these elements within the system prompt, the language model's ability to classify based on nuanced and implicit customer feedback will likely be improved, hence achieving a better alignment with the objective function.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nDog upon story.

Make the identification of implicit satisfaction a central aspect by stressing that many notes may not directly state satisfaction yet can still signify it through a lack of explicit complaints or issues.\n\n2. **Differentiation Between Neutral and Negative**: Clearly distinguish between neutrality and negativity. The prompt could better differentiate neutral comments, which should lean towards \"satisfactory,\" from vague dissatisfaction cues, which should lean towards \"needs_follow_up.\"\n\n3. **Revising Example Integration**: While it suggests considering varied examples, the prompt should integrate specific illustrative examples within the criteria to improve the model\u2019s training input. Including false positives (neutral-example mistakenly classified as needing follow-up) and false negatives (satisfactory-example not recognized) can guide more precise classification.\n\n4. **Amplifying Subtle Cue Sensitivity**: Further enhance focus on detecting and interpreting subtle cues in language, such as minor shades of tone and context that suggest resolution, even without typical resolution markers. This could involve more detailed instructions on evaluating linguistic elements such as word choice and sentence structure.\n\n5. **Avoidance of Over-Simplification**: The directive to be concise might cause the model to oversimplify the complexity of the input notes. Encourage a thoughtful weighing of all cues before concluding, rather than jumping to conclusions based solely on explicit absence or presence of certain words or phrases.\n\nBy integrating these refinements, the prompt could better guide the classification system in identifying the nuanced markers of satisfaction, resulting in improved accuracy in distinguishing between \"satisfactory\" and \"needs_follow_up\" classifications.</FEEDBACK>\n\n\nHere is a conversation:\n\n<CONVERSATION><LM_SYSTEM_PROMPT> You are evaluating a classification system's performance.\n\nThe system was given this input:\nFree southern life.

Explicitly state that unless there is clear language indicating dissatisfaction, a neutral tone should be defaulted to \"satisfactory.\" This can prevent misclassification in ambiguously worded notes.\n\n2. **Clarification on Coherence as Satisfaction**: The current prompt may not emphasize how coherence and logical flow of the note can imply satisfaction. Reinforce that a coherent discussion without signs of dissatisfaction or distress should generally be classified as \"satisfactory.\"\n\n3. **Detailed Scenario Analysis for Contextual Understanding**: In section 3, strengthen the guidance on analyzing the narrative flow by providing decision trees or flow charts. This could facilitate deeper understanding during ambiguous cases by visualizing how different narrative paths lead to a certain classification.\n\n4. **Emphasis on Positive Indicators**: The prompt could benefit from discussing positive indicators of satisfaction such as expressions of gratitude, recognition of effort, or acknowledgment of helpful service indirectly. While the absence of negativity is crucial, the active presence of positivity can more confidently steer classification towards \u201csatisfactory.\u201d\n\n5. **Explicit Default Guidance for Ambiguity**: Provide a statement within the criteria indicating that in cases of complete ambiguity with no clear indicators, the system should lean towards \"satisfactory\" unless more compelling evidence suggests otherwise. This prevents hesitation in classification caused by overly cautious criteria.\n\n6. **Enhance Example Diversity and Relevance**: Revise or expand section 4 by incorporating realistic example notes that feature both explicit satisfaction and neutral tones effectively leading to a \"satisfactory\" classification.

A note is \"satisfactory\" if it implies resolution, contentment, or no further assistance is needed, explicitly or implicitly. Use the following criteria to classify notes:\n\n1. **Neutral and Implicit Satisfaction Signals**: Recognize a note as \"satisfactory\" if it presents a calm or neutral tone, lacks negative feedback, further queries, or requests for assistance. Emphasize that a neutral tone, in the absence of explicit dissatisfaction, should default to \"satisfactory.\"\n\n2. **Absence of Negative Cues**: Identify implicit satisfaction by focusing on the absence of dissatisfaction, escalation cues, and requests for additional help. Coherent narrative flow, absence of anxiety, and normal language should be considered indicators of satisfaction.\n\n3. **Consider Contextual and Narrative Flow**: Analyze the narrative flow for subtle cues and tone shifts that suggest resolution or contentment. Contextual neutrality should generally indicate satisfaction unless negative indicators are present.\n\n4. **Examples and Scenario-Based Learning**: Incorporate diverse examples illustrating how implicit satisfaction is inferred through neutral narratives, context, and tone. Demonstrating varied scenarios helps reinforce these decision-making processes.\n\n5. **Clear Definition of \"Needs Follow-Up\" Triggers**: Define specific signals like explicit dissatisfaction, confusion, or direct requests for help that would necessitate a \"needs_follow_up\" classification. Encourage a comprehensive review of all cues.\n\n6. **Balance Sensitivity and Specificity**: Guide the system to prioritize implicit satisfaction cues while balancing sensitivity to dissatisfaction. Encourage reliance on overall context rather than isolated terms, adopting default \"satisfactory\" classifications in ambiguous cases.\n\nBy implementing these guidelines, you will effectively classify notes as \"satisfactory\" or \"needs_follow_up,\" leveraging both explicit and implicit satisfaction signals appropriately. Be concise and answer with only the classification label. </LM_INPUT>\n\n<LM_OUTPUT> To improve the system's ability to classify the given type of input as 'needs_follow_up', consider the following enhancements to the prompt:\n\n1. **Strengthen the Focus on Subtle Dissatisfaction**: Emphasize the importance of identifying fragmented narratives or disjointed language as potential indicators of dissatisfaction or unresolved issues, even in the absence of explicit words.\n\n2. **Integrate Analysis of Incoherent or Disjointed Statements**: Highlight that an incoherent narrative with seemingly unrelated statements can be a signal of unresolved problems or the need for follow-up. The system should consider lack of coherence as a potential dissatisfaction cue.\n\n3. **Redefine Neutrality Contexts**: Clarify that neutrality should not only be based on the tone but also on how the content logically flows to a resolution. If a note appears random or lacks logical resolution progress, it may require follow-up.\n\n4. **Detect Subtle Indicators of Confusion**: Encourage identification of phrases that appear confused or unclear, and flag these appropriately for follow-up, even if no direct dissatisfaction is stated.\n\n5. **Expand on Narrative Flow Cues**: Provide more explicit examples of narrative flows that lack coherence or indicate confusion, guiding towards a 'needs_follow_up' classification if logical flow or resolution is absent.\n\nImplementing these adjustments would help the system better differentiate between truly neutral/positive contexts and those requiring follow-up due to lack of clarity or coherence. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback and criticism to the variable given the above evaluation output.
